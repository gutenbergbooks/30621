<p><a name = "start" id = "start">This text</a> includes characters that
require UTF-8 (Unicode) file encoding, mainly fractions used in
illustration captions:</p>

<p class = "inset">
⅙ ⅕ ⅔ &nbsp; <i>all rare</i><br>
⅓ &nbsp; (1/3)</p>

<p>If any of these characters do not display properly, or if the
apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as garbage, you
may have an incompatible browser or unavailable fonts. First, make sure
that the browser’s “character set” or “file encoding” is set to Unicode
(UTF-8). You may also need to change your browser’s default font.</p>

<p>The section on musical instruments includes snippets of music in MIDI
format. Depending on your browser, these will either play or be
downloaded. The “music” directory associated with this file includes all
music samples in <b>lilypond</b> format, convertible to several other
music-notation programs.</p>

<p>The proportions (½, ⅓) in figure captions are taken from the original
text; actual sizes may be larger or smaller, depending on your monitor.
The dimensions correspond to a monitor resolution of 100dpi.</p>

ANCIENT ART OF THE PROVINCE OF CHIRIQUI.</a></h2>

<h4><a name = "intro_geog" id = "intro_geog">GEOGRAPHY.</a></h4>

<p>Until comparatively recent times the province of Chiriqui has
remained almost unknown to the world at large. The isthmus was traversed
a number of times by the conquerors, who published accounts of their
discoveries, but it was reserved for the period of railroad and canal
exploration to furnish trustworthy accounts of its character and
inhabitants. The situation of Chiriqui is unique. Forming, politically,
a&nbsp;part of South America, it belongs in reality to the North
American continent. It occupies a part of the great southern flexure of
the isthmus at a point where the shore lines begin finally to turn
toward the north.</p>

<p>The map accompanying this paper (Plate I) conveys a clear idea of the
position and the leading topographic features of the province. The
boundaries separating it from Veragua on the east and Costa Rica on the
west run nearly north and south. The Atlantic coast line has a northwest
and southeast trend and is indented by the bay or lagoon of Chiriqui.
The Bay of David extends into the land on the south and the Gulf of
Dolce forms a part of the western boundary. A&nbsp;range of mountains,
consisting principally of volcanic products, extends midway along the
province, forming the continental watershed.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> The drainage comprises two
systems of short rivers that run, one to the north and the other to the
south, into the opposing oceans. Belts of lowland border the shore
lines. That on the south side is from twenty to thirty miles wide and
rises gradually into a plateau two or three thousand feet in elevation,
which is broken by hills and cut by cañons. This belt affords a natural
thoroughfare for peoples migrating from continent to continent, and
doubtless formed at all periods an attractive district for occupation.
It is in the middle portion of this strip of lowland, especially in the
drainage area of the Bay of David, that the most plentiful evidences of
ancient occupation are found. Scattering remains have been discovered
all along, however, connecting the art of Costa Rica with that of
Veragua, Panama, and
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page014" id = "page014"> </a>
<!-- png 076 -->
the South American continent. The islands of the coast furnish some
fragmentary monuments and relics, and there is no doubt that a vast
quantity of material yet remains within the province to reward the
diligent search of future explorers.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_lit" id = "intro_lit">LITERATURE.</a></h4>

<p>The antiquarian literature of the province is extremely meager, being
confined to brief sketches made by transient visitors or based for the
most part upon the testimony of gold hunters and government explorers,
who took but little note of the unpretentious relics of past ages. As
there are few striking monuments, the attention of archæologists was not
called to the history of primeval man in this region, and until recently
the isthmus was supposed to have remained practically unoccupied by that
group of cultured nations whose works in Peru and in Mexico excite the
wonder of the world. But, little by little, it has been discovered that
at some period of the past the province was thickly populated, and by
races possessed of no mean culture.</p>

<p>The most important contributions to the literature of this region, so
far as they have come to my knowledge, are the following: A&nbsp;paper
by Mr. Merritt, published by the American Ethnological Society;<a class
= "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> a&nbsp;paper by
Bollaert, published by the same society, and also a volume issued in
London;<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a>
a&nbsp;valuable pamphlet, with photographic illustrations, by M.&nbsp;De
Zeltner, French consul to Panama in 1860;<a class = "tag" name = "tag4"
id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> a&nbsp;short paper by Mr. A.&nbsp;L.
Pinart, published in the Bulletin de la Société de Géographie (Paris,
1885, p.&nbsp;433), in which he gives valuable information in regard to
the peoples, ancient and modern; and casual notes by a number of other
writers, some of which will be referred to in the following pages.
A&nbsp;pretty full list of authorities is given by Mr. H.&nbsp;H.
Bancroft in his Native Races, Vol. V, p.&nbsp;16.</p>

<p>One of the most important additions to our knowledge of the province
and its archæologic treasures is furnished in the manuscript notes of
Mr. J.&nbsp;A. McNiel, who made the greater part of the collection now
deposited in the National Museum. This explorer has personally
supervised the examination of many thousands of graves and has forwarded
the bulk of his collections to the United States. His explorations have
occupied a number of years, during which time he has undergone much
privation and displayed great enthusiasm in pursuing the rather thorny
pathways of scientific research. In the preparation of this paper his
notes have been used as freely as their rather disconnected character
warranted, and since Mr. McNiel’s return to the United States, in July,
1886, I&nbsp;have been favored with a
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page015" id = "page015"> </a>
<!-- png 077 -->
series of interviews with him, and by this means much important
information has been obtained.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_people" id = "intro_people">PEOPLE.</a></h4>

<p>At the present time this district is inhabited chiefly by Indians and
natives of mixed, blood, who follow grazing and agriculture to a limited
extent, but subsist largely upon the natural products of the country.
These peoples are generally thought to have no knowledge or trustworthy
tradition of the ancient inhabitants and are said to care nothing for
the curious cemeteries among which they dwell, except as a source of
revenue. Mr. A.&nbsp;L. Pinart states, however, that certain tribes on
both sides of the continental divide have traditions pointing toward the
ancient grave builders as their ancestors. There is probably no valid
reason for assigning the remains of this region to a very high
antiquity. The highest stage of culture here may have been either
earlier or later than the period of highest civilization in Mexico and
South America or contemporaneous with it. There is really no reason for
supposing that the tribes who built these graves were not in possession
of the country, or parts of it, at the time of the conquest. As to the
affinities of the ancient middle isthmian tribes with the peoples north
and south of them we can learn nothing positive from the evidences of
their art. So far as the art of pottery has come within my observation,
it appears to indicate a somewhat closer relationship with the ancient
Costa Rican peoples than with those of continental South America; yet,
in their burial customs, in the lack of enduring houses and temples, and
in their use of gold, they were like the ancient peoples of middle and
southern New Granada.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href =
"#note5">5</a></p>

<p>The relics preserved in our museums would seem to indicate one
principal period of occupation or culture only; but there has been no
intelligent study of the contents of the soil in sections exposed in
modern excavations, the exclusive aim of collectors having generally
been to secure either gold or showy cabinet specimens. The relics of
very primitive periods, if such are represented, have naturally passed
unnoticed. Mr. McNiel mentions the occurrence of pottery in the soil in
which the graves were dug, but, regarding it as identical with that
contained in the graves, he neglected to preserve specimens.</p>

<p>In one instance, while on a visit to Los Remedios, a pueblo near the
eastern frontier of Chiriqui, he observed a cultivated field about which
a ditch some 8 or 9 feet in depth had been dug. In walking through this
he found a continuous exposure of broken pottery and stone implements.
Some large urns had been cut across or broken to conform to the slope of
the ditch, and were exposed in section.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page016" id = "page016"> </a>
<!-- png 078 -->
<p>Although not apparently representing a very wide range of culture or
distinctly separated periods of culture, the various groups of relics
exhibit considerable diversity in conception and execution,
attributable, no doubt, to variations in race and art inheritance.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_cemeteries" id = "intro_cemeteries">
THE CEMETERIES.</a></h4>

<p>The ancient cemeteries, or huacals, as they are called throughout
Spanish America, are scattered over the greater part of the Pacific
slope of Chiriqui. It is said by some that they are rarely found in the
immediate vicinity of the sea, but they occur in the river valleys, on
the hills, the plateaus, the mountains, and in the deepest forests. They
are very numerous, but generally of small extent. The largest described
is said to cover an area of about twelve acres. They were probably
located in the immediate vicinity of villages, traces of which, however,
are not described by explorers; but there can be no doubt that diligent
search will bring to light the sites of dwellings and towns. The absence
of traces of houses or monuments indicates either that the architecture
of this region was then, as now, of destructible material, or, which is
not likely, that so many ages have passed over them that all traces of
unburied art, wood, stone, or clay, have yielded to the “gnawing tooth
of time.”</p>

<p>One of the most circumstantial accounts of these burial places is
given by Mr. Merritt, who was also the first to make them known to
science.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a>
Mr. Merritt was director of a gold mine in Veragua, and in the summer of
1859 spent several weeks in exploring the graves of Chiriqui; he
therefore speaks from personal knowledge. In the autumn of 1858 two
native farmers of the parish of Bugaba, or Bugava, discovered a golden
image that had been exposed by the uprooting of a plant. They proceeded
secretly to explore the graves, the existence of which had been known
for years. In the following spring their operations became known to the
people, and within a month more than a thousand persons were engaged in
working these extraordinary gold mines. The fortunate discoverers
succeeded in collecting about one hundred and thirty pounds weight of
gold figures, most of which were more or less alloyed with copper. It is
estimated that fifty thousand dollars’ worth in all was collected from
this cemetery, which embraced an area of twelve acres.</p>

<p>Although there are rarely surface indications to mark the position of
the graves, long experience has rendered it comparatively easy to
discover them. The grave hunter carries a light iron rod, which he runs
into the ground, and thus, if any hard substance is present, discovers
the existence of a burial. It is mentioned by one or two writers that
the graves are in many cases marked by stones, either loose or set in
the ground in rectangular and circular arrangements. The
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page017" id = "page017"> </a>
<!-- png 079 -->
graves do not often seem to have had a uniform position in relation to
one another or to the points of the compass. In some cases they are
clustered about a central tomb, and then assume a somewhat radiate
arrangement; again, according to Mr. McNiel, they are sometimes placed
end to end, occupying long trenches.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_graves" id = "intro_graves">THE GRAVES.</a></h4>

<p>Graves of a particular form are said to occur sometimes in groups
occupying distinct parts of the cemetery, but the observations are not
sufficiently definite to be of value. The graves vary considerably in
form, construction, and depth, and are classified variously by
explorers. In the Bugaba cemetery Mr. Merritt found two well marked
varieties, the oval and the quadrangular, reference being had to the
horizontal section. The oval grave pits were from 4½ to 6 feet deep and
from 3 to 4 feet in greatest diameter. A&nbsp;wall of rounded river
stones 2½ to 3 feet high lined the lower part of the pit, and from the
top of this the entire space was closely packed with rounded stones.
Within the faced up part of this cist the remains of the dead, the
golden figures, pottery, and implements had been deposited. This form is
illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;1&nbsp;by a vertical section constructed from
the description given by Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 1.</span> Section of oval grave.</p>

<p>The quadrangular graves were constructed in two somewhat distinct
ways. One variety was identical in most respects with the oval form
illustrated above. They were sometimes as much as 6 feet deep and
frequently 4 by 7 feet in horizontal dimensions. In the other form a pit
4 by 6½ feet in diameter was sunk to the depth of about 3 feet.
Underneath this another pit some 2 feet in depth was sunk, leaving an
offset or terrace 8 or 10 inches in width all around. The smaller pit
was lined with flat stones placed on edge. In this cist the human
remains and the relics were placed and covered over with flat stones,
which rested upon the terrace and prevented the superincumbent mass,
which consisted of closely packed river stones, from

crushing the contents. A&nbsp;section of this tomb is given in
Fig.&nbsp;2, also drawn from the description given by Mr. Merritt.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 2.</span> Section of a quadrangular
grave, showing the surface pack of river stories and the positions of
the slabs and objects of art.</p>

<p>Mr. Merritt and others mention that in some of the graves pillars are
employed to support the roof of the cist. These pillars are mentioned
briefly by De Zeltner, from whose account the following illustrations
are drawn. This author does not state that he made any personal
investigations, and if his accounts were obtained from the natives their
entire trustworthiness may very properly be questioned. The first two
forms mentioned by him are similar to those already given. The third is
described as having at the corners square pillars of stone to support
the covering, which, however, is not described. The fourth has four
pillars, placed in the corners of the pit. These serve to support a
vault of flagstones. The walls between the pillars are faced with
pebbles, as in the cases previously described. Fig.&nbsp;3&nbsp;will
make this form clear at a glance. The fifth variety described by De
Zeltner is quite extraordinary in construction. His account is somewhat
confusing in a number of respects, and the section given in
Fig.&nbsp;4&nbsp;cannot claim more than approximate accuracy in details
and measurements. Near the surface a paving, perhaps
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page019" id = "page019"> </a>
<!-- png 081 -->
of river stones, was found covering an area of about 10 by 13 feet. This
paving was apparently the surface of a pack about 2 feet thick, and
covered the mouth of the main pit, which was some 6 or 7 feet deep.
Pillars of cobble stones about 10 inches in diameter occupied the
corners of the pit, and probably served in a measure to support the
paving. In the bottom of this excavation a second pit was dug, the mouth
of which was also covered by a paving 2½ by upwards of 3 feet in
horizontal dimensions. This lower pit consisted of a shaft several feet
in depth, by which descent was made into a chamber of inverted pyramidal
shape. This chamber approximated 6 by 9 feet in horizontal dimensions
and was some 4 or 5 feet deep. At the bottom of this cistern the human
remains and most of the relics were deposited. The shaft was filled in
with earth and the pavings described. The total depth, computed from the
figures given, is about 18 feet, a&nbsp;most remarkable achievement for
a barbarous people; yet this is equaled by the ancient tribes of the
mainland of New Granada, where similar burial customs seem to have
prevailed. Mr. White,<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a> who traveled extensively in the northwestern part of the
state, says:</p>

<p class = "quotation">
A dry, elevated ridge, composed of easily excavated material, was
selected as the cemetery. A&nbsp;pit of only a yard or so in diameter
was sunk, sometimes vertically, sometimes at an angle, or sometimes it
varied from vertical to inclined. It was sunk to depths varying from 15
to 60 feet, and at the bottom a chamber was formed in the earth. Here
the dead was deposited, with his arms, tools, cooking utensils,
ornaments, and chattels generally, with maize and fermented liquor made
of maize. The chamber and passage were then rammed tightly full of
earth, and sometimes it would appear that peculiar earth, other than
that excavated on the spot, was used. One not unfrequently detects a
peculiar aromatic smell in the earth, and fragments of charcoal are
always found mixed with it in more or less quantity.</p>

<p>M. De Zeltner describes other very simple graves which are filled in
with earth, excepting a surface paving of pebbles.</p>

<p>Mr. McNiel, who has examined more examples than any other white man,
and over a wide district with David as a center, discredits the
statements of De Zeltner in respect to the form illustrated in
Fig.&nbsp;4, and states that generally the graves do not differ greatly
in shape and finish from the ordinary graves of to-day. He describes the
pits as being oval and quadrangular and as having a depth ranging from a
few feet to 18 feet. The paving or pack consists of earth and water worn
stones, the latter pitched in without order and forming but a small
percentage of the filling. He has never seen such stones used in facing
the walls of the pit or in the construction of pillars. The flat stones
which cover the cist are often 10 or 15 feet below the surface and are
in some cases very heavy, weighing 300 pounds or more. A&nbsp;single
stone is in cases large enough to cover the entire space, but more
frequently two or more flat stones are laid side by side across the
cavity. These are supported by river stones, a&nbsp;foot or more in
length, set around the margin of the cist. He is of the opinion that
both slabs and bowlders were in many cases carried long distances. No
one of the pits examined was of the extraordinary form described in
detail by De Zeltner and others.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_remains" id = "intro_remains">
HUMAN REMAINS.</a></h4>

<p>The almost total absence of human remains has frequently been
remarked, and the theory is advanced that cremation must have been
practiced. We have no evidence, however, of such a custom among the
historic tribes of this region, and, besides, such elaborate tombs would
hardly be constructed for the deposition of ashes. Yet, considering the
depth of the graves, their remarkable construction, and the character of
the soil selected for burial purposes, it is certainly wonderful that
such meager traces of human remains are found. Pinart surmises, from the
analogies of modern burial customs upon the north coast, that the bones
only were deposited in the graves, the flesh having been allowed to
decay by a long period of exposure in the open air. This, however, would
probably not materially hasten the decay of the bones.</p>

<p>Mr. Merritt states that human hair was obtained from graves at
Bugaba, and that he has himself secured the enamel of a molar tooth from
that locality. De Zeltner tells us that in three varieties of graves
remains of skeletons are found, always, however, in a very fragile
condition. One skull was obtained of sufficient stability to be cast in
plaster, but De Zeltner is not certain that it belonged to the people
who built the tombs.</p>

<p>Mr. McNiel reports the occasional finding of bones, and a number of
bundles of them are included in his collection. He reports that there
are no crania and that nothing could be determined as to the position of
the bodies when first buried.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page021" id = "page021"> </a>
<!-- png 083 -->
<p>Pinart observes that in some cases the bodies or remnants of bodies
were distributed about the margin of the pit bottom, with the various
utensils in the center, and again that the remains were laid away in
niches dug in the sides of the main pit.</p>

<p>These scattering observations will serve to give a general idea of
the modes of sepulture practiced in this region, but there must be a
closer record of localities and a careful correlation of the varying
phenomena of inhumation before either ethnology or archaeology can be
greatly benefited.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_relics" id = "intro_relics">
PLACING OF RELICS.</a></h4>

<p>The pieces of pottery, implements, and ornaments were probably buried
with the dead, pretty much as are similar objects in other parts of
America. The almost total disappearance of the human remains makes a
determination of exact relative positions impossible. The universal
testimony, however, is that all were not placed with the body, but that
some were added as the grave was filled up, being placed in the crevices
of the walls or pillars or thrown in upon the accumulating earth and
pebbles of the surface pavement. The heavy implements of stone are
rarely very far beneath the surface.</p>


<h3><a name = "objects" id = "objects">OBJECTS OF ART.</a></h3>

<p>From the foregoing account it is apparent that our knowledge of the
art of ancient Chiriqui must for the present be derived almost entirely
from the contents of the tombs. The inhabitants were skillful in the
employment and the manipulation of stone, clay, gold, and copper; and
the perfection of their work in these materials, taken in connection
with the construction of their remarkable tombs, indicates a culture of
long standing and a capacity of no mean order.</p>

<p>Of their architecture, agriculture, or textile art we can learn
little or nothing.</p>

<p>The relics represented in the collection of the National Museum
consist chiefly of articles of stone, gold, copper, and clay.</p>


<h4><a name = "stone" id = "stone">
STONE.</a><a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =

<p>Works executed in stone, excluding the tombs, may be arranged in the
following classes: Pictured rocks, sculptured columns, images, mealing
stones, stools, celts, arrowpoints, spear&shy;points&nbsp;(?), polishing
stones, and ornaments.</p>

<h6><a name = "stone_pictured" id = "stone_pictured">
Pictured rocks.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>Our accounts of these objects are very meager. The only one
definitely described is the “<i>piedra pintal</i>.” A few of the figures
engraved upon it are given by Seemann, from whom I quote the following
paragraph:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page022" id = "page022"> </a>
<!-- png 084 -->
<p class = "quotation">
At Caldera, a&nbsp;few leagues [north] from the town of David, lies a
granite block known to the country people as the piedra pintal, or
painted stone. It is 15 feet high, nearly 50 feet in circumference, and
flat on the top. Every part, especially the eastern side, is covered
with figures. One represents a radiant sun; it is followed by a series
of heads, all, with some variation, scorpions and fantastic figures. The
top and the other side have signs of a circular and oval form, crossed
by lines. The sculpture is ascribed to the Dorachos (or&nbsp;Dorasques),
but to what purpose the stone was applied no historical account or
tradition reveals.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">9</a></p>

<p>These inscriptions are irregularly placed and much scattered. They
are thought to have been originally nearly an inch deep, but in places
are almost effaced by weathering, thus giving a suggestion of great
antiquity. I&nbsp;have seen tracings of these figures made recently by
Mr. A.&nbsp;L. Pinart which show decided differences in detail, and Mr.
McNiel gives still another transcript. I&nbsp;present in
Fig.&nbsp;5&nbsp;Mr. McNiel’s sketch of the southwest face of the rock,
as he has given considerably more detail than any other visitor. Mr.
McNiel’s sketches show seventeen figures on the opposite side of the
rock. Seemann gives only twelve, while Mr. Pinart’s tracings show
upwards of forty upon the same face. These three copies would not be
recognized as referring to the same original. That of Mr. Pinart seems
to show the most careful study and is probably accurate. Good
photographs would be of service in eliminating the inconvenient personal
equation always present in the delineation of such subjects. These
figures bear little resemblance to those painted upon the vases of this
region.</p>

<p>Other figures are said to be engraved upon the bowlders and stones
used in constructing the burial cists. De Zeltner states that “one often
meets with stones covered with rude allegorical designs, representing
men, pumas (tigre?), and birds. It is particularly in such huacas as
have pillars and a vault that these curious specimens of Indian art are
found.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href =

says that they may be seen in David, where they are used for building
purposes,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href =

<p>Objects that may properly be classed as images or idols are of rather
rare occurrence. Half a dozen specimens are found in the McNiel
collections. The most important of these represents a full length female
figure twenty-three inches in height. It is executed in the round, with
considerable attempt at detail (Fig.&nbsp;6). I&nbsp;may mention, as
strong characteristics, the flattened crown, encircled by a narrow
turban-like band, the rather angular face and prominent nose, and the
formal pose of the arms and hands. Besides the head band, the only other
suggestion of costume is a belt about the waist.</p>

<p>The material is a compact, slightly vesicular, olive gray, basaltic

In general style there is a rather close correspondence with the
sculptures of the Central American States. Some of the plastic
characters exhibited in this work appear also in the various objects of
clay, gold, and copper described further&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>There is also a smaller, rudely carved, half length, human figure
done in the same style. Besides these figures there are two large
flattish stones, on one of which a rude image of a monkey has been
picked, while the other exhibits the figure of a reptile resembling a
lizard or a crocodile. The work is extremely rude and has the appearance
of being unfinished. It seems that all of these objects were found upon
the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>In Figs. 7 and 8 I present two specimens of sculpture also collected
by Mr. McNiel, and now in the possession of Mr. J.&nbsp;B. Stearns, of
Short Hills, N.J. The example shown in Fig.&nbsp;7&nbsp;was obtained
near the Gulf of Dolce, 82°&nbsp;55´ west. Three views are presented:
profile, front, and back. It is carved from what appears to be a
compact, grayish olive tufa or basalt, and represents a male personage,
distinct in style from the female figure first presented. The head is
rounded above, the arms are flattened against the sides, and the feet
are folded in a novel position beneath the body. The height is 9
inches.</p>

<p>A remarkable figure of large size now in the National Museum was
obtained from the Island of Cana or Cano by Mr. McNiel. It is nearly
three feet in height and very heavy. The face has been mutilated. In
general style it corresponds more closely to the sculpture of the
Central American States than to that of Chiriqui.</p>

Mealing stones.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The metate, or hand mill, which consists of a concave tablet and a
rubbing stone, was an important adjunct to the household appliances of
nearly all the more cultured American nations. It is found not only in
those plain substantial forms most suitable for use in grinding grain,
seeds, and spices by manual means, but in many cases it has been
elaborated into a work of art which required long and skilled labor for
its production.</p>

<p>In the province of Chiriqui these mills must have been numerous; but,
since they are still in demand by the inhabitants of the region, many of
the ancient specimens have been destroyed by use. It seems from all
accounts that they were not very generally buried with the dead, but
were left upon or near the surface of the ground, and were hence
accessible to the modern tribes, who found it much easier to transport
them to their homes than to make new ones.</p>

<p>The metates of Chiriqui present a great diversity of form and
possibly represent distinct peoples or different grades of culture. They
are carved from volcanic rocks of a few closely related varieties, the
texture of which is coarse and occasionally somewhat cellular, giving an
uneven or pitted surface, well suited to the grinding of maize. Three
classes, for convenience of description, may be distinguished, although
certain characters are common to all and one form grades

more or less completely into another. We have the plain slab or rudely
hewn mass of rock, in the upper surface of which a shallow depression
has been excavated; we have the carefully hewn oval slab supported by
short legs of varied shape; and we have a large number of pieces
elaborately sculptured in imitation of animal forms. The first variety
is common to nearly all temperate and tropical America and does not
require further attention here. The second variety exhibits considerable
diversity in form. The tablet is oval, concave above, and of an even
thickness. The periphery is often squared and is in many cases
ornamented with carved figures, either geometric devices or rudely
sculptured animal heads. The legs are generally three in number, but
four is not unusual. They are mostly conical or cylindrical in shape and
are rather short.</p>

<p>The finest example of the second class has an oval plate 37 inches in
length, 29 in width, and 2 inches thick, which is nearly symmetrical and
rather deeply concave above. The central portions of the basin are worn
quite smooth. Near the ends, within the basin, two pairs of small
animal-like figures are carved, and ranged about the lower margin of the
periphery are eighty-seven neatly sculptured heads of animals. There are
four short cylindrical legs. This superb piece of work is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;9.</p>

<p>Examples of the third class are all carved to imitate the puma or
ocelot. The whole creature is often elaborately worked out in the round
from a single massive block of stone. The thin tablet representing the
body rests upon four legs. The head, which projects from one end of the
tablet, is generally rather conventional in style, but is sculptured
with sufficient vigor to recall the original quite vividly. The tail
appears at the other end and curves downward, connecting with one of the
hind feet, probably for greater security against mutilation. The head,
the margin of the body, and the exterior surfaces of the legs are
elaborately decorated with tasteful carving. The figures are geometric,
and refer, no doubt, to the markings of the animal’s skin. Nearly
identical specimens are obtained from Costa Rica and other parts of
Central America.</p>

<p>A fine example of medium size is given in Fig. 10. The material is
gray, minutely cellular, basaltic rock. The upper surface of the plate
is polished by use. The entire length is 17 inches.</p>

<p>The largest specimen in the McNiel collection is 2 feet long, 18
inches wide, and 12 inches high. A&nbsp;similar piece has been
illustrated by De Zeltner.</p>

<p>The usual office of these metates is considered to be that of
grinding corn, cocoa, and the like. The great elaboration observed in
some examples suggests the idea that perhaps they were devoted
exclusively to the preparation of material (meal or other substances)
intended for sacred uses. A&nbsp;high degree of elaboration in art
products results in many cases from their connection with superstitious
usages.</p>

<p>Speculating upon the use of these objects, De Zeltner mentions a
mortar “whose pestle was nothing but a round stone, which still shows
traces of gold here and there. It was evidently with the help of this
rude instrument that the Indians reduced the gold to powder before
fusing it.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13" href =

<p>The implement or pestle used in connection with these mealing tablets
in crushing and grinding is often a simple river worn pebble, as
mentioned above, but is more usually a cylindrical mass of volcanic
rock, worked into nearly symmetric shape.</p>

Stools.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The stool-like appearance of some of the objects described as metates
suggests the presentation in this place of a group of objects that must
for the present be classed as stools or seats, although their true or
entire function is unknown to me. They are distinguished from the
mealing stones by their circular plate, their sharply defined, upright,
marginal rim, and the absence of signs of use.</p>

and most interesting is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;11. It is carved from a
piece of vesicular basaltic tufa and is in a perfect state of
preservation. The height is 6 inches and the diameter of the top 10
inches, that of the base being a little less. The slightly concave upper
surface is depressed about half an inch below the upright marginal band.
The periphery is a little more than an inch in width and is decorated
with a simple guilloche-like ornament in relief. The disk-like cap is
connected by open lattice-like work with the ring which forms the base.
The interior is neatly hollowed out. The open work of the sides consists
of two elaborately carved figures of monkeys, alternating with two
sections of trellis work, very neatly executed. The other specimen is
somewhat less elaborate in its sculptured ornament<ins class =

<p>Outlines of two additional examples of these objects are given in
Figs. 12 and 13. The tablets are round, thick, and slightly concave

perforated.</p>

<p>As bearing upon the possible use of these specimens it should be
noticed that similar stool-like objects are made of clay, the softness
and fragility of which would render them unsuitable for use as mealing
plates or mortars, and it would also appear that they are rather fragile
for use as stools. I&nbsp;would suggest that they may have served as
supports for articles such as vases or idols employed in religious
rites, or possibly as altars for offerings.</p>

Celts.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The class of implements usually denominated celts is represented by
several hundred specimens, nearly all of which are in a perfect state of
preservation. They are thoroughly well made and beautifully finished,
and leave the impression upon the mind that they must represent the very
highest plane of Stone Age art.</p>

<p>Although varying widely in form and finish there is great homogeneity
of characters, the marked family resemblance suggesting a single people
and a single period or stage of culture. They are found in the cists
along with other relics and are very generally distributed,
a&nbsp;limited number, rarely more than three, being found in a single
grave. They may be classified by shape into a number of groups, each of
which, however, will be found to grade more or less completely into the
others. They display all degrees of finish from the freshly flaked to
the evenly picked and wholly polished surface. The edges or points of
nearly all show the contour and polish that come from long though
careful use. All are made of compact, dark, volcanic tufa that resembles
very closely a fine grained slate. The following illustrations include
all the more important types of form. There are but few specimens of
very large size. That shown in Fig.&nbsp;14 is 8¼ inches long,
4&nbsp;inches wide, and seven-eighths of an inch thick. The blade is
broad at the edge, rounded in outline, and well polished. The upper
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page030" id = "page030"> </a>
<!-- png 092 -->
end terminates in a rather sharp point that shows the rough flaked
surface of the original blocking out. The middle portion exhibits an
evenly picked surface. The rock is a dark slaty looking tufa, the
<ins class = "correction" title = "hyphen at line break missing">surface</ins>
of which displays ring or rosette-like markings,
reminding one of the polished surface of a section of fossil coral.
These markings probably come from the decomposition of the mineral
constituents of the rock.</p>

<p>The implement given in Fig. 15 may be taken as a type of a large
class of beautifully finished celts. It also is made of the dark tufa,
very fine grained and compact, resembling slate. The beveled surfaces of
the blade are well polished, the remainder of the surface being evenly
picked. The hexagonal section is characteristic of the class, but it is
not so decided in this as in some other pieces in which the whole
surface is freshly ground.</p>

Ornaments.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>It would seem from a study of our collections that ornaments of stone
were seldom used by the inhabitants of Chiriqui. There are a few medium
sized beads of agate and one pendant of dark greenish stone rudely
shaped to resemble a human head. Ornaments of gold and copper were
evidently much preferred.</p>

<h5><a name = "metal_gold" id = "metal_gold">GOLD AND COPPER.</a></h5>

<p>The Chiriquians, like many of their neighbors in the tropical
portions of the American continent, were skilled in the working of
metals. Gold, silver, copper, and tin&mdash;the last in alloys with
copper forming bronze&mdash;are found in the graves. Gold is the most
important, and is associated with all the others in alloys or as a
surface coating. The inhabitants of the isthmus at the time of the
discovery were rich in objects, chiefly ornaments, of this metal, and
expeditions sent out under Balboa, Pizarro, and others plundered the
natives without mercy. When the Indian village of Darien was captured by
Balboa (1510) he obtained “plates of gold, such as they hang on their
breasts and other parts, and other things, all of them amounting to ten
thousand pesos of fine gold.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag14" id =
"tag14" href = "#note14">14</a> From an expedition to Nicaragua the same
adventurers brought back to Panama the value of “112,524 pieces of eight
in low gold, and 145 in pearls.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag15" id =
"tag15" href = "#note15">15</a> Early Spanish-American history abounds
in stories of this kind. Among others we read that Columbus found the
natives along the Atlantic coast of Chiriqui and Veragua so rich in
objects of gold that he named the district <i>Castillo del Oro</i>. It
is said that the illusory stories of an <i>El Dorado</i> somewhere
within the continent of South America arose from the lavish use of gold
ornaments by the natives whom the Spaniards encountered, and that Costa
Rica gets its name from the same circumstance. It is also recorded that
the natives of various parts of Central and South America at the date of
the conquest were in the habit of opening ancient graves for the purpose
of securing mortuary trinkets. The whites have followed their example
with the greatest eagerness. As far back as 1642 the Spaniards passed a
law claiming all the gold found in the burial places of Spanish
America,<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =

revenue.</p>

<p>The objects of gold for which the tombs of Chiriqui are justly famous
are generally believed to have been simple personal ornaments, the
jewelry of the primeval inhabitants, although it is highly probable that
many of the figures, at least as originally employed, had an emblematic
meaning. They were doubtless at all times regarded as possessed of
potent charms, and thus capable of protecting and forwarding the
interests of their owners. They have been found in great numbers within
the last twenty-five years, but for the most part, even at this late
date, have been esteemed for their money value only. Very many specimens
found their way to this country, where they were either sold for
curiosities or, after waiting long for a purchaser, even in the very

pot. Many stories bearing upon this point have been told me.
A&nbsp;Washington jeweler is represented as having exhibited in his
window on Pennsylvania avenue about the year 1860 a remarkable series of
these trinkets, most of which were afterwards sent to New York to be
melted. About the same period a gentleman on entering a shop in San
Francisco was accosted by a stranger who had his pockets well filled
with these curious relics and wished to dispose of them for cash.
A&nbsp;number of my acquaintances have neat but grotesque examples of
these little images of gold attached to their watch guards, thus
approving the taste of our prehistoric countrymen and at the same time
demonstrating the identity of ideas of personal embellishment in all
times and with all peoples.</p>

<p>The ornaments are found only in a small percentage of the graves,
those probably of persons sufficiently opulent to possess them in life;
a&nbsp;majority of the graves contain none whatever. They are often
found at the bottom of the pits, and probably in nearly the position
occupied by them while still attached to the persons of the dead. It is
said that occasionally they are found in niches at the sides of the
graves, as if placed during the filling of the pit.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the gold is very generally alloyed with copper, the
composite metal ranging from pure gold to pure copper. A&nbsp;small
percentage of silver is also present in some of the specimens examined,
but this is probably a natural alloy. In a few cases very simple figures
appear to have been shaped from nuggets or masses of the native metals;
this, however, is not susceptible of proof. The work is very skillfully
done, so that we find it difficult to ascertain the precise methods of
manipulation. The general effect in the more pretentious pieces
resembles that of our filigree work, in which the parts are produced by
hammering and united by soldering; yet there are many evidences of
casting, and these must be considered with care. As a rule simple
figures and some portions of composite figures present very decided
indications of having been cast in molds, yet no traces of these molds
have come to light, and there are none of those characteristic markings
which result from the use of composite or “piece” molds. Wire was
extensively used in the formation of details of anatomy and
embellishment, and its presence does not at first seem compatible with
ordinary casting. This wire, or pseudo-wire it may be, is generally
about one-twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The manner in which the numerous parts or sections of complex figures
are joined together is both interesting and perplexing. Evidences of the
use of solder have been looked for in vain, and if such a medium was
ever used it was identical in kind with the body of the object or so
small in quantity as to escape detection. At the junction of the parts
there are often decided indications of hammering, or at least of the
strong pressure of an implement; but in pursuing
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page037" id = "page037"> </a>
<!-- png 099 -->
the matter further we find a singular perfection in the joining, which
amounts to a coalescence of the metals of the two parts concerned. There
is no weakness or tendency to part along the contact surfaces, neither
is there anything like the parting of parallel wires in coils or where a
series of wires is joined side by side and carried through various
convolutions. In a number of cases I made sections of coils and parts
composed of a number of wires, in the hope of discovering evidences of
the individuality of the strands, but the metal in the section is always
homogeneous, breaking with a rough, granular fracture, and not more
readily along apparent lines of junction than across them; and further,
in studying in detail the surface of parts unpolished or protected from
wear by handling, we find everywhere the granular and pitted unevenness
characteristic of cast surfaces. This is true of the wire forms as well
as of the massive parts, and, in addition to this, such defects occur in
the wires as would hardly be possible if they were of wrought gold.</p>

<p>All points considered, I am inclined to believe that the objects were
cast, and cast in their entirety. It is plain, however, that the
original model was made up of separately constructed parts of wire or
wirelike strands and of eccentric and often rather massive parts, and
that all were set together by the assistance of pressure, the
indications being that the material used was sufficiently plastic to be
worked after the manner of clay, dough, or wax. In one case, for
example, the body of a serpent, consisting of two wires neatly twisted
together, is held in the hand of a grotesque figure. The hand consists
of four fingers made by doubling together two short pieces of wire. The
coil has been laid across the hand and pressed down into it until half
buried, and the ends of the fingers are drawn up around it without any
indication of hammer strokes. Indeed, the effect is just such as would
have been produced if the artist had worked in wax. Again, in the
modeling of the eyes we have a good illustration. The eye is a minute
ball cleft across the entire diameter by a sharp implement, thus giving
the effect of the parted lids. Now, if the material had been gold or
copper, as in the specimens, the ball would have been separated into two
parts or hemispheres, which would not exhibit any great distortion; but
as we see them here the parts are flattened and much drawn out by the
pressure of the cutting edge, just as if the material had been decidedly
plastic.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the processes of manufacture must have been
analogous to those employed by the more primitive metal workers of our
own day. In Oriental countries delicate objects of bronze and other
metals are made as follows: A&nbsp;model is constructed in some such
material as wax or resin and over it are placed coatings of clay or
other substance capable of standing great heat. These coatings, when
sufficiently thickened and properly dried, form the mold, from which the
original model is extracted by means of heat. The fused
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page038" id = "page038"> </a>
<!-- png 100 -->
metal is afterwards poured in. As a matter of course, both the mold and
the model are destroyed in each case, and exact duplications are not to
be expected. Mr. George F. Kunz, of New York, with whom I have discussed
this matter, states that he has seen live objects, such as insects, used
as models in this way. Being coated with washes of clay or like
substance until well protected and then heavily covered, they were
placed in the furnace. The animal matter was thus reduced to ashes and
extracted through small openings made for the purpose.</p>

<p>As bearing upon this subject it should be mentioned that occasionally
small figures in a fine reddish resin are obtained from the graves of
Chiriqui. They are identical in style of modeling with the objects of
gold and copper obtained from the same source.</p>

<p>In discussing possible processes, Mr. William Hallock, of the
division of chemistry and physics of the United States Geological
Survey, suggested that if the various sections of a metal ornament were
embedded in the surface of a mass of fire clay in their proper relations
and contacts they could then be completely inclosed in the mass and
subjected to heat until the metal melted and ran together. After
cooling, the complete figure could be removed by breaking up the clay
matrix. I&nbsp;imagine that in such work much difficulty would be
experienced in securing proper contact and adjustment of parts of
complex figures. It will likewise be observed that evidences of
plasticity in the modeling material would not exist. I&nbsp;must not
pass a suggestion of Nadaillac<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" id =
"tag17" href = "#note17">17</a> which offers a possible solution of the
problem of manipulation. Referring to a statement of the early Spanish
explorers that smelting was unknown to the inhabitants of Peru, he
states that it would be possible for a people in a low state of culture
to discover that an amalgam of gold with mercury is quite plastic, and
that after a figure is modeled in this composite metal the mercury may
be dissipated by heat, leaving the form in gold, which then needs only
to be polished. There is, however, no evidence whatever that these
people had any knowledge of mercury.</p>

<p>There is no indication of carving or engraving in the Chiriquian
work. In finishing, some of the extremities seem to have been shaped by
hammering. This was a mere flattening out of the feet or parts of the
accessories, which required no particular skill and could have been
accomplished with comparatively rude stone hammers. It is a remarkable
fact that many, if not most, of the objects appear to be either plated
or washed with pure gold, the body or foundation being of base gold or
of nearly pure copper. This fact, coupled with that of the association
of objects of bronze with the relics, leads us to inquire carefully into
the possibilities of European influence or agency. I&nbsp;observe that
recent writers do not seem to have questioned the genuineness of the
objects described by them, but that at the same time no mention is made
of the plating or washing. This latter circumstance
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page039" id = "page039"> </a>
<!-- png 101 -->
leads to the inference that pieces now in my possession exhibiting this
phenomenon may have been tampered with by the whites. In this connection
attention should be called to the fact that history is not silent on the
matter of plating. The Indians of New Granada are said to have been not
only marvelously skillful in the manipulation of metals, but, according
to Bollaert, Acosta declares that these peoples had much <i>gilt</i>
copper, “and the copper was gilt by the use of the juice of a plant
rubbed over it, then put into the fire, when it took the gold color.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag18" id = "tag18" href = "#note18">18</a> Just
what this means we cannot readily determine, but we safely conclude
that, whatever the process hinted at in these words, a&nbsp;thin surface
deposit of pure gold, or the close semblance of it, was actually
obtained. It is not impossible that an acid may have been applied which
tended to destroy the copper of the alloy, leaving a deposit of gold
upon the surface, which could afterwards be burnished down.</p>

<p>It has been suggested to me that possibly the film of gold may in
cases be the result of simple decay on the part of the copper of the
alloy, the gold remaining as a shell upon the surface of the still
undecayed portion of the composite metal; but the surface in such a case
would not be burnished, whereas the show surfaces of the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘speci-/imens’ at line break">specimens
</ins> recovered are in all cases neatly polished.</p>

<p>If we should conclude that the ancient Americans were probably able
to secure in some such manner a thin film of gold, it still remains to
inquire whether there may not have been some purely mechanical means of
plating. In some of the Chiriquian specimens a foundation of very base
metal appears to have been plated with heavy sheet gold, which as the
copper decays comes off in flakes. Occasional pieces have a blistered
look as a consequence. Were these people able with their rude appliances
to beat gold into very thin leaves? and Had they discovered processes by
which these could be applied to the surfaces of objects of metal? are
questions that should probably be answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The flakes in some cases indicate a very great degree of thinness.
Specimens of sheet gold ornaments found in the tombs are thicker, but
are sufficiently thin to indicate that, if actually made by these
people, almost any degree of thinness could be attained by them. It
would probably not be difficult to apply thin sheet gold to the
comparatively smooth surfaces of these ornaments and to fix it by
burnishing.</p>

<p>Mr. Kunz suggests still another method by means of which plating
could have been accomplished. If a figure in wax were coated with sheet
gold and then incased in a clay matrix, the wax could be melted out,
leaving the shell of gold within. The cavity could then be filled with
alloy, the clay could be removed, and the gold, which would adhere to
the metal, could then be properly burnished down.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page040" id = "page040"> </a>
<!-- png 102 -->
<p>It will be seen from this hasty review that, although we may conclude
that casting and plating were certainly practiced by these peoples, we
must remain in ignorance of the precise methods employed.</p>

<p>Referring to the question of the authenticity of the specimens
themselves, I&nbsp;may note that observations bearing upon the actual
discovery of particular specimens in the tombs are unfortunately
lacking. Mr. McNiel acknowledges that with all his experience in the
work of excavation no single piece has been taken from the ground with
his own hands, and he cannot say that he ever witnessed the exhumation
by others, although he has been present when they were brought up from
the pits. Generally the workmen secrete them and afterwards offer them
for sale. He has, however, no shadow of a doubt that all the pieces
procured by him came from the graves as reported by his collectors. The
question of the authenticity of the gilding will not be satisfactorily
or finally settled until some responsible collector shall have taken the
gilded objects with his own hands from their undisturbed places in tombs
known to be of pre-Columbian construction.</p>

<p>There are many proofs, however, of the authenticity of the objects
themselves. It is asserted by a number of early writers that the
American natives were, on the arrival of the Spaniards, highly
accomplished in metallurgy; that they worked with blowpipes and cast in
molds; that the objects produced exhibited a high order of skill; and
that the native talent was directed with unusual force and uniformity
toward the imitation of life forms. It is said that the conquerors were
“struck with wonder” at their skill in this last respect. And a strong
argument in favor of the genuineness of these objects is found in the
fact that it is not at all probable that rich alloys of gold would have
been used by Europeans for the base or foundation when copper or bronze,
or even lead, would have served as well. We also observe that there is
absolutely no trace of peculiarly European material or methods of
manipulation, a&nbsp;condition hardly possible if the extensive
reproductions were made by the whites. Neither are there traces of
European ideas embodied in the shapes or in the decoration of the
objects&mdash;a circumstance that argues strongly in favor of native
origin. An equally convincing argument is found in the fact that all the
alloys liable to corrosion exhibit marked evidences of decay, as if for
a long period subject to the destructive agents of the soil. In many
cases the copper alloy base crumbles into black powder, leaving only the
flakes of the plating. Lastly and most important, the strange creatures
represented are in many cases identical with those embodied in clay and
in stone, and for these latter works no one will for a moment claim a
foreign derivation.</p>

<p>Considering all these arguments, I arrive at the conclusion that the
ornaments are, in the main, genuine antiquities, and that, if any
deception at all has been practiced, it is to be laid at the door of
modern
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page041" id = "page041"> </a>
<!-- png 103 -->
goldsmiths and speculators, who, according to Mr. McNiel, are known in a
few cases to have “doctored” alloyed objects with washes of gold with
the view of selling them as pure gold.</p>

<p>I present the following specimens with a reasonable degree of
confidence that all, or nearly all, are of purely American fabrication,
and I sincerely hope that at no distant day competent archæologists may
have the opportunity of making personal observations of similar relics
in place.</p>

<p>The objects consist to a great extent of representations of life
forms, in many cases more fanciful than real and often extremely
grotesque. They include the human figure and a great variety of birds
and beasts indigenous to the country, in styles resembling work in clay
and stone of the same region. My illustrations show the actual sizes of
the objects.</p>

<h6>The human figure.&mdash;</h6>

<p>Statuettes of men and women and of a variety of anthropomorphic
figures of all degrees of elaboration abound. Fig.&nbsp;26 illustrates a
plain, rude specimen belonging to the collection of J.&nbsp;B. Stearns.
It was obtained by Mr. McNiel from near the south base of Mount
Chiriqui. The body is solid and the surface is rough and pitted, as if
from decay. In many respects it resembles the stone sculptures of the
isthmus. The metal is nearly pure copper. A&nbsp;piece exhibiting more
elaborate workmanship, illustrated by Bollaert,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag19" id = "tag19" href = "#note19">19</a> is shown in Fig.&nbsp;27.
Another remarkable specimen is illustrated by De Zeltner, but the
photograph published with his brochure is too indistinct to permit of
satisfactory reproduction. He describes it in the following
language:</p>

<p class = "quotation">
The most curious piece in my collection is a gold figure of a man,
7&nbsp;centimeters in height. The head is ornamented with a diadem
terminated on each side with the head of a frog. The body is nude,
except a girdle, also in the form of a plait, supporting a flat piece
intended to cover the privates, and two round ornaments on
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>

each side. The arms are extended from the body; the well drawn hands
hold, one of them a short, round club, the other a musical instrument,
of which one end is in the mouth and the other forms an enlargement like
that of a flute, made of human bone. It is not probable that this is a
pipe. Both thighs have an enlargement, and the toes are not marked in
this little figurine.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id = "tag20" href =

by Mr. McNiel, and now owned by Mr. Stearns. It exhibits features
corresponding with a number of those referred to by De Zeltner. The
foundation is thin and is of base metal coated with pure gold.
I&nbsp;present two additional examples of the human figure from the
collection of Mr. Stearns.

</div>
One of them (Fig.&nbsp;29) is an interesting little statuette in dark
copper that still retains traces of the former gilding of yellow gold.
The crown is flat and is surrounded by a fillet of twisted wire. The
face is grotesque, the nose being bulbous, the mouth large, and the lips
protruding. The hands are represented as grasping cords of wire which
connect the waist with the crown of the figure and seem to be intended
for the bodies of serpents, the heads of which project from the sides of
the headdress. Similar serpents project from the ankles. The feet are
flattened out as if intended to be set in a crevice. The
extremities&mdash;excepting the feet&mdash;and the ornaments are all
formed of wire. The various parts of the figure have been modeled
separately and set together while the material was in a plastic or
semiplastic condition. This is clearly indicated by the sinking of one
part into another at the points of contact.</div>

<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page044" id = "page044"> </a>
<!-- png 106 -->
<p>An excellent example of the more elaborate figures is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;30. It is of reddish gold, slightly alloyed apparently with
copper, and has in finishing received a very thin wash or plating of
yellow gold, which is worn off in exposed parts. The central feature of
the rather complicated structure is a grotesque human figure, much like
the preceding, and having counterparts in both clay and stone. The
figure is backed up and strengthened by two curved and flattened bars of
gold, one above and the other below, as seen in the cut. The figure is
decked with and almost hidden by a profusion of curious details,
executed for the most part in wire and representing serpents and birds.
Three vulture-like heads project from the crown and overhang the face.
Two serpents, the bodies of which are formed of plaited wire, issue from
the mouth of the figure and are held about the neck by the hands. The
heads of the serpents are formed of wire folded in triangular form and
are supplied with double coils of wire at the sides, as if for ears, and
with little balls of gold for eyes. Similar heads project from the sides
of the head and from the feet of the image.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 30.</span> Grotesque human figure in

<p>The peculiarities of construction are seen to good advantage in this
specimen. The figure is made up of a great number of separate pieces,
united apparently by pressure or by hammering while the material was
somewhat plastic. Upwards of eighty pieces can be counted. The larger
pieces, forming the body and limbs, are hollow or concave behind. Nearly
all the subordinate parts are constructed of wire.</p>

<h6>The bird.&mdash;</h6>

<p>Images of birds are numerous and vary greatly in size and
elaboration. They are usually represented with expanded wings and tails,
the under side of the body being finished for show. The back is left
concave and rough, as when cast, and is supplied with a ring for
suspension or attachment, as seen in the profile view (Fig.&nbsp;31).
The owl, the eagle, the parrot, and various other birds are recognized,
although determinations of varieties are not possible, as in many cases
the forms are rude or greatly obscured by extraneous details. The
example shown in Fig.&nbsp;31 is of the simplest type and the rudest
workmanship, and is apparently intended for some rapacious species,
possibly a vulture. The body, wings, and tail are
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page045" id = "page045"> </a>
<!-- png 107 -->
hammered quite thin and are left frayed and uneven on the edges. The
material appears to be nearly pure copper plated with yellow gold.
Specimens of this class are very numerous. One, presented in a
publication of the Society of Northern Antiquaries, and now in the
museum at Copenhagen, is thought to be intended for a fish hawk, as it
carries a fish in its mouth. De Zeltner mentions a statuette in gold of
a paroquet, whose head is ornamented with two winged tufts. Such a
specimen may be seen in the collection of Mr. Stearns.</p>

<p>Representations of quadrupeds are common; a&nbsp;good example, copied
from Bollaert, is given in Fig.&nbsp;33. The animal intended is
apparently a puma, a&nbsp;favorite subject with Chiriquian workers in
clay and stone as well as in gold. The body is hollow and open beneath
and the fore feet are finished with loops for suspension. A&nbsp;similar
piece with head thrown back over the body is shown in Fig.&nbsp;34. The

<h6>Grotesque figure.&mdash;</h6>

<p>Another piece collected by Mr. McNiel is outlined in Fig.&nbsp;35.
The metal is quite base and the surface has been coated with gold, which
is now nearly all rubbed off. The shape is that of a quadruped. The face
has a rather grotesque, not to say satanic, expression. The details are
not unlike those of other examples previously given.</p>

<h6>The fish.&mdash;</h6>

<p>The fish was a favorite subject with the ancient nations of South
America, and is modeled in clay, woven into fabrics, and worked in
metals with remarkable freedom. It was in great favor in Chiriqui and
must have been of importance in the mythology of the country. It occurs
most frequently in pottery, where it is executed in color and modeled in
the round. The very grotesque specimen in gold shown in Fig.&nbsp;36 is
copied from Harper’s Weekly of August 6, 1859, where it forms one of a
number of illustrations of these curious ornaments. The paper is,
I&nbsp;believe, by Dr. F.&nbsp;M. Otis, who had just returned from
Panama. A&nbsp;very curious piece owned by Mrs. Philip Phillips, of
Washington, represents a creature having some analogies
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page047" id = "page047"> </a>
<!-- png 109 -->
with the fish figure of Otis. Issuing from the mouth is the same forked
tongue, each part terminating in a serpent’s head. The body is about two
inches long and the back has five triangular perforations. The tail is
forked and the four leg-like members terminate in conventional serpents’
heads. The metal is pure or nearly pure gold.</p>

<h6>The frog.&mdash;</h6>

<p>The frog appears in the plastic art of Chiriqui more frequently
perhaps than any other reptile. Its form is reproduced with much spirit
and in greatly varying sizes, degrees of elaboration, and styles of
presentation. It is probable that a number of species are represented.
In Fig.&nbsp;37 we have a large, rather plain specimen, now in the
National Museum. The body and limbs are concave beneath, the metal being
about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Teeth are suggested by a number of
perforations encircling the jaws and the eyes are minute hawk bells
containing pellets of metal. The legs are
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page048" id = "page048"> </a>
<!-- png 110 -->
placed in characteristic positions, and the hind feet are broad plates
without indications of toes, a&nbsp;characteristic of these golden
frogs. The framework or foundation is of copper, apparently nearly pure,
and the surface is plated with thin sheet gold, which tends to flake off
as the copper foundation corrodes.</p>

<h6>The alligator.&mdash;</h6>

<p>The alligator, which appears so frequently in the pottery of
Chiriqui, is only occasionally found in gold. A&nbsp;striking specimen,
illustrated in Harper’s Weekly of August 6, 1859, is given in
Fig.&nbsp;39. A&nbsp;similar piece, formed of base metal, is in the
collection of Mr. Stearns.</p>

<p>In Fig. 40 we have a fine specimen, intended apparently to represent
a crayfish or some similar crustacean form. The head is supplied with
complicated yet graceful antenna-like appendages,

made of wire neatly coiled and welded together by pressure or hammering.
The eyes are globular and are encircled by the ends of a double loop of
wire which extends along the back and incloses a line of minute balls or
nodes. The peculiar wings and tail will be best understood by referring
to the illustration. The foundation metal is much corroded, being dark
and rotten, and the plating of reddish gold seems to have been coated
with a thin film of yellow gold. The profile view gives a good idea of
the thickness of the metal and of the relief of the parts. Two rings or
loops of doubled wire are attached to the extreme end of the nose and a
heavy ring for suspending is fixed to the under side of the head.</p>

<h6>Miscellaneous.&mdash;</h6>

<p>Gold, pure and in the usual alloys, was also used in the manufacture
of other articles, such as bells, beads, disks, balls, rings, whistles,
thimble shaped objects, and amulets of varied shapes. Bells are more
generally made of bronze, because, perhaps, of its greater degree of
resonance. Thin plates, or rather circular sheets, of gold leaf are
numerous. One mentioned by Bollaert was 7¼ inches in diameter. They are
plain or crimped about the margins, indented in various ways, and
sometimes perforated, apparently for suspension or attachment. Merritt
mentions examples having holes which showed evidences of wear upon one
side only, indicating attachment in a fixed position to some object or
to some part of the costume. But one example is at hand, a&nbsp;thin
sheet, three inches in diameter and crimped or indented neatly about the
margin. Its thickness is about that of ordinary tinfoil.</p>

<h6>Bells.&mdash;</h6>

<p>Bells seem to have been in pretty general use by the more cultured
American races previous to the conquest. The form best known is the hawk
bell, or common sleighbell of the North. The globular body is suspended
by a loop at the top and is slit on the under side, so that the tinkling
of the small free pellets of metal may be audible. Such bells are found
in considerable numbers in the graves of Chiriqui, although I have no
positive assurance that any of the examples in my possession were
actually taken from graves which contained typical Chiriquian relics of
other classes. The specimens now in the National Museum (Fig.&nbsp;41)
are in most cases, if not in all, of bronze, as determined by Mr.
R.&nbsp;B. Riggs, of the chemical laboratory of the United States
Geological Survey. All have been cast in molds. In most cases there are
traces of a plating of gold. The largest is 1¼ inches in height and
three-fourths of an inch in diameter. It is surmounted by the rude
figure of an animal, through or beneath the body of which is an opening
for the attachment of a cord. Others have simple loops at the top. The
small perforated specimen belongs to Mr. Stearns. The additional piece
given in Fig.&nbsp;42 is unique in conception. It represents a human
head, which takes an inverted position
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page050" id = "page050"> </a>
<!-- png 112 -->
when the bell is suspended. The lower part of the bell forms a conical
crown to the head and the ring of suspension is attached to the chin.
Double coils of wire take the place of the ears, and the other features
are formed by setting on bits of the material used in modeling. This
specimen belongs to the collection of Mr. Stearns. Many examples of more
elaborate workmanship have been recovered from the tombs and are now to
be found in the collections of America and Europe.</p>

<p>A specimen found many years ago on the Rio Grande, near Panama, and
figured in Harper’s Weekly, was of gold and showed specific variations
from the Chiriquian pieces. It will be seen by reference to the outline
given in Fig.&nbsp;43 that three very neatly shaped and gracefully
ornamented bells are mounted upon a circular plate to which a short
handle is attached. It was evidently not intended for suspension, but
rather to be held in the hand as a rattle.</p>

<p>A question as to the authenticity of these bells as aboriginal works
very naturally arises, and it may be difficult to show to the
satisfaction of the skeptical mind that any particular specimen is not
of European origin or inspiration. At the same time we are not without
strong evidences that such bells were in use by the Americans before the
advent of the whites. Historical accounts are not wanting, but I shall
only stop to point out some of the internal evidences of the native art.
The strongest argument is to be found in the presence
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page051" id = "page051"> </a>
<!-- png 113 -->
of analogous features in other branches of the art and in other arts.
The eyes of the golden figures of reptiles are in many cases minute hawk
bells, and in works of clay, the purely aboriginal character of which
has not been called in question, similar features are discovered. The
American origin of the bell, therefore, is not to be questioned. The
form originated, no doubt, in the rattle, at first a nutshell or a
gourd; later it was modeled in clay, and in time the same idea was
worked out in the legs and the ornaments of vessels and in the heads and
other parts of animal forms, which were made hollow and supplied with
tinkling pellets. With the acknowledged skill of these people in the
working of metals, there is no reason why the bells described should not
have been manufactured independently of European aid and influence,
provided the requisite metal was at hand.</p>

</div>

<p>It should be observed that if these early American bells were copied
from or based upon Spanish originals they would not probably vary
greatly in type with the various sections from which they are recovered,
but it is observed that marked and persistent differences do occur. The
well known Mexican bell, an example of which is outlined in
Fig.&nbsp;44, although of bronze, is generically distinct in form and
construction.</p>

<p>In a brief review I may recall the more salient points regarding the
use of metals in ancient Chiriqui. Gold, silver, copper, and apparently
tin are represented.</p>

<p>Gold and copper were very plentifully distributed among the isthmian
races, but we have little information as to the sources of supply. Free
gold is found in the stream beds of many localities, and copper was
probably found in its native state in some convenient locality; yet it
is not impossible that these metals were transported from distant
regions, as the inhabitants of Chiriqui must have had considerable
intercourse with those of Central America on the north and with those of
Granada on the south. Silver and tin are found in alloys with gold and
copper, but not as independent metals. The silver gold alloy is probably
a natural compound. In no case have I found silver to exceed 6 per cent.
of the composite metal. Tin was artificially alloyed with copper,
forming bronze. The latter metal resembles our ordinary bronze in color
and hardness, but I am unable to secure more than a qualitative analysis
on account of the scarcity of specimens available for the purpose. We
have no information in regard to the origin of the tin. It is not found
in a native state, and since it seems hardly probable that the
Chiriquians understood smelting ores we are left in doubt as to whether
it was obtained from more cultured nations to the north or to the south
or from transoceanic countries.</p>

<p>The gold-copper alloys appear to range between pure gold and pure
copper. If the bronze is of European origin, then we must conclude that
all objects made of that metal are of post-Columbian manufacture. This
question will probably be definitely settled in the near future.</p>

<p>The greater number of the objects were formed by casting in molds.
Hammering was but little practiced, excepting, apparently, in the
formation of sheet gold, which was probably an indigenous product.
Repoussé work is not found, save as represented in the crimping and
indenting of gold leaf. Engraving and carving were not practiced. It may
be considered certain that gilding, or at least plating, was
understood.</p>

<p>The objects are obtained from ancient graves of which no record or
reliable tradition is preserved. They are all ornaments, no coin,
weapon, tool, or utensil having come to my notice. The absence of
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page053" id = "page053"> </a>
<!-- png 115 -->
utensils and of hammered objects of any kind strikes me as being rather
extraordinary, since it is popularly supposed that, in the normal
succession of events, hammering should precede casting and that utensils
should be made before elaborate ornaments.</p>

<p>The work exhibits close analogies with that of the mainland of South
America, but these analogies appear to be in material, treatment, and
scope of employment rather than in the subject matter of the
conceptions. The personages and zoömorphic characters represented are
characteristically Chiriquian, and were derived no doubt from the
mythology of the locality. These works affiliate with the various works
in stone and clay, the art products of the province thus constituting a
fairly homogeneous whole and being entirely free from traces of European
influence.</p>

<p>Metals do not come into use early in the history of a race, as they
are not found in shapes or conditions suitable for immediate use, nor
are they sufficiently showy when found to be especially desirable for
ornaments. A&nbsp;long period must have elapsed before the use of metals
was discovered, and a longer period must have passed before they were
worked; and, in the light of our knowledge of the ancient tribes of the
United States, it would seem that a considerable degree of culture may
be achieved before the casting of metals is understood; but in the
ordinary course of progress the discovery of methods of alloying rare
metals would be far separated from that of the simple fusing and casting
of a single metal, such as gold. The Chiriquian peoples not only had a
knowledge of the methods of alloying gold with copper, and, apparently,
copper with tin, but, if our data are correct, they were able to plate
the baser metals and alloys with sheet gold, and, what is far more
wonderful, to wash them with gold, producing an effect identical with
that of our galvanic processes.</p>

<p>The character of the conceptions embodied in the art unite with
evidences of technical skill to prove to us that American culture, as
represented by the metal ornaments of Chiriqui, was not the product of a
day, but of long periods of experiment and progress.</p>

Preliminary.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The importance of the potter’s art to archæology has often been
pointed out. Baked clay is one of the most enduring materials utilized
in art, and its employment by the races of men has fallen but little
short of universal. The creations of that noblest of arts, architecture,
and the antecedent forms of house building are necessarily left where
erected, to be fed upon by the remorseless elements of nature, but the
less pretentious utensil of clay accompanies its owner to the tomb,
where it remains practically unchanged for ages.</p>

<p>Many glimpses of the early history of the American races and of
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page054" id = "page054"> </a>
<!-- png 116 -->
the progress of art in pre-Columbian times are obtained through these
exhumed relics, and in no case have we a view more clear and
comprehensive than that furnished in the series here presented. The
graves of Chiriqui have yielded to a single explorer upwards of 10,000
pieces of pottery, and this chiefly from an area perhaps not more than
fifty miles square. These vessels constitute at least 90 per cent. of
the known art of the ancient occupants of the province, and, although
not so eloquent of the past as are the inscribed tablets of Assyria or
the pictured vases of Greece, they tell a story of art and of peoples
that without their aid would remain untold to the end of time.</p>

<p>A careful study of the earthenware of this province leads to the
conclusion that for America it represents a very high stage of
development, and its history is therefore full of interest to the
student of art. Its advanced development as compared with other American
fictile products is shown in the perfection of its technique, in the
high specialization of form, and in its conventional use of a wide range
of decorative motives. There is no family of American ware that bears
evidence of higher skill in the manipulation of clay or that indicates a
more subtile appreciation of beauty of form, and no other that presents
so many marked analogies to the classic forms of the Mediterranean.
Strangely enough, too, notwithstanding the well established fact that
only primitive methods of manufacture were known, there is a parallelism
with wheel made ware that cannot but strike the student with
amazement.</p>

<p>In speaking thus of the whole body of ceramic products, I would not
convey the impression that there is perfect homogeneity throughout, as
if all were the work of a single people developed from within, and
therefore free from the eccentricities that come from exotic influence.
On the contrary, there is strong evidence of mixed conditions of races
and of arts, the analysis of which, with our present imperfect data,
will be extremely difficult. These evidences of mixed conditions are
found in the marked diversity and individuality of character of the
various groups of ware.</p>

<p>It is impossible, without the aid of careful observations in the
field, to arrive at any conclusion as to the relative age of the
different varieties of ware. Appearances of age are deceptive; the newer
looking varieties may be the older and those executed in the most
primitive style may belong to the later period, for grades in culture
are not chronologic.</p>

<p>With reference to the principal groups of relics, we cannot do better
than accept the statements of collectors that all are buried in like
ways and in similar tombs, different varieties in many cases occurring
in the same tomb. There are, however, in a few minor groups such marked
distinctions in workmanship and style that we are compelled to attribute
them to different periods or to distinct communities.
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page055" id = "page055"> </a>
<!-- png 117 -->
The groups separated most completely from others are the scarified
pottery presented first in the series of painted wares, the maroon
group, which follows, and other varieties represented by fugitive
pieces. The latter may have reached Chiriqui from neighboring provinces.
There are certain pieces that speak decidedly of Costa Rican influence
and others that find their counterparts in the Colombian states to the
south.</p>

<p>In art in clay in most countries the vessel is the leading idea, the
center about which nearly the entire ceramic art is gathered. This is
true in a marked degree in Chiriqui, and vessels are therefore given the
first place in this paper. The less usual forms include drums, whistles,
rattles, stools, spindle whorls, needlecases, and toy-like images, all
of which present features of peculiar interest. These classes of objects
are discussed in separate sections.</p>

<p>There are few indications of an ambition to model natural forms or
mythologic figures independently of utensils and useful objects, and,
strange to say, no pieces are found that portray the human face and
figure with even a fair degree of approach to nature.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_howfound" id = "pottery_howfound">
How found.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>In describing the graves and tombs in a previous section,
I&nbsp;alluded to the manner in which the pottery was deposited. It
appears to have been buried with the dead or thrown into the grave with
the earth and stones with which the pit was filled. There was little
regularity in the place or position of the vessels and many were broken
when found. The precise use of the vessels, the character of the
contents, or the relation of particular pieces to the remains of the
dead cannot be determined. Although the human remains have almost
entirely disappeared and there are no traces left of utensils of wood,
bone, horn, or shell, the paste, slip, and colors are wonderfully well
preserved and the surface is not even discolored by contact with the
earth. When found, every crevice and cavity is completely filled with
earth, and the paste is often so tender that the vessels have to be
dried with great care before they can be handled with freedom. The
number of pieces found in a grave sometimes reaches twenty, but the
average is perhaps not above three or four.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_material" id = "pottery_material">
Material.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The material used in the manufacture of this ware is remarkably
uniform throughout the whole province, varying slightly with the
locality, with the group, and with the character of the vessel
constructed. Generally the paste consists of a matrix of fine clay
tempered with finely pulverized sand, in which may be detected grains of
quartz, feldspar, hornblende, augite, particles of iron oxide, &amp;c.
Argillaceous matter has been sparingly used, the sand in many cases
comprising at least 75 per cent. of the mass. Many of the unpainted
specimens, from which the polished slip has been removed, give off
showers of fine sand when rubbed by the hand, and it is difficult to
detect the presence of any finely comminuted matrix whatever. The
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page056" id = "page056"> </a>
<!-- png 118 -->
thin slip employed in surface finish is more highly argillaceous than
the paste. The clay used was probably mostly light in color, as the
paste is now quite uniformly so. The baking was effected apparently
without a very high degree of temperature and by methods that left few
marks or discolorations upon the vessels. In hardness and durability the
paste corresponds pretty closely with that of our red porous
earthenware. The softer pieces can be scratched or even carved with a
knife. Water will penetrate any of these vessels in a few minutes, but
decay has probably tended to make the walls more porous.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_manuf" id = "pottery_manuf">
Manufacture.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>There is no piece of this ware that does not bear evidence of a high
degree of skill on the part of the potter; and yet, owing to the
thorough manner in which the work is finished, the precise methods of
manipulation are not easily detected. So great is the symmetry and so
graceful are the shapes that one is led to suspect the employment of
mechanical devices of a high order. The casual observer would at once
arrive at the conclusion that the wheel or molds had been used, but it
is impossible to detect the use of any such appliances. We observe that
irregular and complex forms, in the production of which mechanical
appliances could not be used to advantage, are modeled with as much
grace of contour and perfection of surface as are the simpler shapes
that could be turned upon a wheel, and we conclude that with this
remarkable people the hand and the eye were so highly educated that
mechanical aids were not indispensable. I&nbsp;find no evidence that
coil building was systematically practiced, but it is clear that parts
of complex forms were modeled separately and afterwards united. The
various ornaments in relief (the heads and other parts of animals) and
the handles, legs, and bases of vessels were constructed separately and
then luted on, and with such skill that the thinnest walls and the most
complex and delicate forms were not injured in the process. The contact
irregularities were then worked down, and every part of the surface,
including the more important ornaments, were rendered smooth,
preparatory to the application of the thin surface wash or slip. After
the slip was applied and the clay became somewhat indurated, the surface
was polished with smooth pebbles, the marks of which can be seen on the
less accessible parts of the vessel. On the exposed surfaces of certain
groups of ware the polish is in many cases so perfect that casual
observers and inexperienced persons take it for a glaze. Incised figures
and painted decorations were generally executed after the polishing was
complete. Details of processes will be given as the various classes of
ware pass under review.</p>

<p>The methods of baking were apparently of a higher order than those
practiced in many parts of America. One rarely discovers traces of the
dark discolorations that result from primitive methods of baking, yet
there are none of the contact marks that arise from the furnace firing
of Spanish-American potters.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page057" id = "page057"> </a>
<!-- png 119 -->
<h6><a name = "pottery_color" id = "pottery_color">
Color.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The colors of the ware and of the surface applications vary decidedly
with the different groups. The prevailing colors of the paste may be
defined as ranging from very light yellow grays to a variety of ochery
yellows and very pale terra cotta reds. In one or two groups there is an
approach to salmon and orange hues, and in another the color is black or
dark brown. The color within the mass is in some cases darker than upon
the surface, an effect produced in baking, and not through the use of
different clays. The slip is usually lighter than the surface of the
paste.</p>

<p>The colors used in finishing and decorating are confined to reds,
blacks, and purple grays. In one large group of ware the appearance of
the delineations is such as to lead to the conclusion that the principal
pigment or fluid employed in delineation has totally disappeared,
carrying with it all underlying colors not of unusual permanence or not
worked down with the polishing implement. The Aztec and other races of
tropical America used an argillaceous, white pigment in decorating their
wares, which has in many cases partially or wholly disappeared, carrying
away considerable portions of the colors over which it was laid, while
in other cases, and also in this Chiriqui ware, there is no trace of
color remaining and we are left to surmise that the brush used probably
contained merely a “taking out” medium. Red was profusely used and
varies from a light vermilion to a deep maroon. In certain classes of
vessels it was hastily daubed on, covering prominent parts of the
surface or forming irregular spots, streaks, and rude figures. In two
groups of ware it was used as the chief delineating color. In some cases
it was employed as a wash or slip and was worked down with the polishing
stone, and in this condition it was treated as a ground upon which to
execute designs in other colors. It is always a fast color and is
probably of mineral character.</p>

<p>The blacks are of two kinds, which are used in distinct groups of
ware: one, probably a mineral pigment, somewhat pasty when applied and
quite permanent, is always used in delineating the ornamental figures;
the other, possibly a vegetable tint, is always used as a ground upon
which to execute designs in other mediums. It is confined to a single
group of ware. It has in many cases disappeared entirely, and where
remaining can be removed with ease by rubbing.</p>

<p>A light purple tint is tastefully and sparingly employed in one group
of ware. Browns and other hues occur but rarely and in all cases result
from alterations of other colors produced in firing. The color effects
of this pottery, although evidently much modified by age, are
sufficiently rich to be highly pleasing to the eye.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_use" id = "pottery_use">
Use.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The uses to which most classes of earthen products were applied are
easily determined. Whistles, drums, rattles, and spindle whorls have
definite duties to perform, and vessels, as to general scope of
function, answer for themselves: but when we come to inquire
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page058" id = "page058"> </a>
<!-- png 120 -->
into the particular uses of the various groups of vessels we are often
at a loss. The majority of the pieces show no abrasion by handling or
discoloration by fire or by contents, and I am inclined to believe that
a large portion were taken directly from the furnace and deposited in
the tombs. This implies manufacture for purely mortuary purposes.</p>

<p>Two important groups, the high tripods and the two handled cups or
pots, are generally discolored by use over fire, but we cannot say with
confidence whether that use was a domestic one or whether it was
ceremonial. The small size and the elaborate modeling of a majority of
the pieces make it appear improbable that they were intended for use in
ordinary cooking or even in the preparation of beverages. A&nbsp;few
large plain caldrons are found, and these were probably domestic
receptacles. All things considered, it would seem highly probable that
the greater portion of the vessels exhumed from the graves were intended
to be used for religious and mortuary purposes.</p>

<p>The preceding paragraphs refer, for the most part, to the whole body
of earthenware products, but throughout the rest of this section I shall
treat of vessels only, except in the matter of decoration, which refers
equally to all classes of objects.</p>

Forms of vessels.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>Divesting the utensil of extraneous features, such as rims, handles,
and legs, we have the following series of shapes, which shows a pretty
full graduation of outline from extreme to extreme. Beginning with the
simplest fundamental form, the shallow cup (Fig.&nbsp;45, <i>a</i>), we
ascend gradually to more complex outlines, such as are seen in the
hemispherical bowl&nbsp;(<i>b</i>), the deep basin with slightly
incurved rim (<i>c</i>), the globular form&nbsp;(<i>d</i>), and the
elongated form &nbsp;(<i>e</i>). Occasionally we see an eccentric
variation, such as is shown in&nbsp;<i>f</i>. Flat bottoms are unusual;
a&nbsp;conical base is the rule. Outlines do not always exhibit these
even, convex curves, but many are straight or concave in profile, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;46. Complex
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page059" id = "page059"> </a>
<!-- png 121 -->
forms are shown in Fig.&nbsp;47, <i>a</i> and&nbsp;<i>b</i>, and
compound forms in Fig.&nbsp;48, <i>a</i> and&nbsp;<i>b</i>. Examples of
these classes are numerous and important. The compound shapes result
from the union of two or more simple forms. Eccentric forms are numerous
and result in a majority of cases from the employment of some animal as
a model. Thus, if an alligator or almost any quadruped is embodied in
the vessel, the form tends to become elongated; if a crab or a fish is
imitated, there is a tendency to flatness &amp;c. The base is almost
universally more or less conical, is rarely flat, and never concave,
excepting as the result of the addition of an annular foot or stand. The
radical shapes do not undergo any considerable change when rims, necks,
handles, legs, and other appendages are added. The rim or lip is in many
cases incurved, but as a rule it is turned outward. The margin is plain,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page060" id = "page060"> </a>

symmetrical, and often considerably thickened. In a few instances the
outline is rectangular or scalloped, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;49, and the
attachment of handles often leads to peculiar outlines, as will be seen
further&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>The neck in its simplest form is a narrow upright band surrounding
the orifice (Fig.&nbsp;50,&nbsp;<i>a</i>) and is not differentiated from
the rim. Variations in size and shape are shown in the remaining figures
of the series. In <i>b</i> it is a narrow constricted band beneath an
overhanging rim, in <i>c</i> it is upright and considerably elongated,
and in <i>d</i> it expands, giving a funnel shaped mouth. The exterior
surface is very generally decorated with relieved or painted devices.
High necked bottles and pitcher shaped vessels are unknown.</p>

<p>Handles constitute a very interesting feature of this pottery and are
much varied in shape and arrangement. In a few cases the handle is a
single arch springing over the orifice, as seen in Fig.&nbsp;51,
<i>a</i>. Again, the handle is attached to one side, as in <i>b</i>, but
as a rule handles occur in twos upon the shoulder, one on either side of
the aperture. They are horizontally attached, as in <i>c</i>, or
vertically placed, as in <i>d</i>, connecting the rim with the shoulder,
or they occur low on the body, as in <i>e</i>. In rare cases there are
four handles, which are arranged as seen in <i>f</i> or are set on in
pairs. In the elaboration of handles, the use made of animal forms is
perhaps the most notable feature. Grotesque figures are made to take the
place of handles or are attached to or placed near

<p>Annular bases or feet were not in very general use in Chiriqui,
although in some cases they are modeled with a great deal of grace. The
shape varies from a simple ring, barely deep enough to give a firm
support to the vessel when placed upon a level surface, to a long,
attenuated column with flaring base. The latter is perhaps one of the
nearest approaches which America has furnished to the slender foot
characteristic of the wheel made ware of Mediterranean countries.</p>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 52, <i>a</i>, has a somewhat rudimentary
foot; another, <i>b</i>, a firm, wide base, which is perforated to give
lightness; an hourglass-like piece is shown in <i>c</i>, and a long,
bell shaped foot is seen in <i>d</i>. In no part of the world do earthen
vessels exhibit such a remarkable development of legs as in Southern
Central America. The tripod is the favorite support, and in Chiriqui the
forms are more graceful than in the neighboring provinces. In a few
cases, where the body was modeled in close imitation of animal forms,
four legs were used, but three were generally preferred, even for
vessels of rectangular or irregular shapes. In the simplest form they
are small conical knobs, placed rather close together about the base of
the vessel (Fig.&nbsp;53, <i>a</i>), but from these the dimensions
increase until the size is out of all reasonable proportion. The maximum
development in point of expansion is seen in <i>b</i> and the greatest
height in <i>c</i>. They are frequently modeled after life forms. In a
few cases rings or loops are employed, as shown in <i>d</i>. The larger
forms, and especially those imitating animals, are hollow and contain
round pellets of clay that rattle when the vessel is moved. The manner
in which the legs are attached to the body of the vessel leads me to
observe that the vessel is independently
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page062" id = "page062"> </a>
<!-- png 124 -->
a perfect utensil, and that in all probability the tripod was a feature
acquired late in the progress of Chiriquian culture, as a result of some
change in the surroundings of the people or in the uses to which the
vessel was devoted. Annular bases and tripods would be of little use
until level floors of unyielding material came into vogue.</p>

Decoration.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>In decoration the pottery of this province exhibits many remarkable
features. The work resembles somewhat closely, in a number of its
features, that of certain districts lying to the north and to the south,
but at the same time it is possessed of very decided individuality. From
an examination of the designs I conclude that they represent a period of
culture considerably inferior to that of some more northern sections,
although the ware itself is nowhere surpassed in grace of form and
delicacy of finish.</p>

<p>The ornamentation is pretty evenly divided between plastic and flat
forms. The former include relieved features and intaglio features, which
are executed in the plastic clay, and the latter comprise figures in
color, penciled or painted upon the surface. Each style of work embodies
its own peculiar class of conceptions. Relief work is generally
realistic or grotesque; incised work is almost exclusively geometric,
and embraces combinations of lines usually recognized as archaic. An
occasional example is easily recognized as imitative. Painted figures
are both geometric and imitative, the two forms blending
imperceptibly.</p>

<p>The more important plastic decorations consist of animal forms
modeled in the round. Vegetable forms have not been employed. Fillets of
clay imitating twisted cords are sparingly used in the decoration of
necks and handles, and rows and groups of small nodes are similarly
employed. The human figure is always treated in a conventional and
usually in a grotesque manner. The animals imitated include a very large
number of species. Crocodiles, pumas, armadillos, monkeys, crabs,
lizards, scorpions, frogs, and fish appear very frequently. Many of the
animals, owing to conventional treatment or to carelessness on the part
of the modeler, are difficult of identification. These plastic forms
occur in nearly all the groups of ware, and similar forms are found to a
limited extent in gold, copper, and stone, as will be seen by reference
to the illustrations already given. Their study will, I&nbsp;believe,
give some insight into the mental characteristics of the Chiriquians.
That their art, so far as these figures are concerned, was not serious
is indicated by the sketchy, unsystematic nature of the work, and more
especially by the grotesque and occasionally amusing representation of
men and animals.</p>

<p>The exuberance of fancy often found vent in the production of

and legs of the figures are writhing serpents, the faces expressing
great agony; in other cases the figures are double; and again two bodies
united at the waist have but one pair of legs. An unusually grotesque
creature is seen in Figs. 59 and 60, and another is given in
Fig.&nbsp;61. Similar figures are worked in gold, one of which is now
worn as a charm by Mr. J.&nbsp;B. Stearns. Figures of monkeys are shown
in Figs. 62, 63, and 64. One creature, represented as having a long,
trunk-like snout, recurs frequently. Such a form discovered in the
earlier days of archæologic investigation would probably have given
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page065" id = "page065"> </a>
<!-- png 127 -->
rise to many surmises as to the contemporaneous existence of man and the
elephant in Chiriqui. In reality the original was probably some
unassuming little inhabitant of the isthmian jungles. This creature is
shown in profile in Fig.&nbsp;65, <i>a</i>, and front views are given in
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. Innumerable examples, embracing most of the more
important animals of Chiriqui, could be given, but in a majority of
cases identification is difficult or impossible, as there has been
little or no effort to reproduce nature with fidelity. But the chief
interest surrounding these figures is not found in the variety of
creatures shown or in the character of the delineation, but in the
manner of their employment in the embellishment of ceramic forms. The
ancient potter must have possessed a keen sense of grace of form and of
the proper adjustment of parts. The most cultured taste could hardly
improve upon the lines of the vases presented in Figs. 66 and 67, which
employ the frog, and in Figs. 68 and 69, in which other creatures are
used. Many equally pleasing examples are illustrated further on. The
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page066" id = "page066"> </a>
<!-- png 128 -->
question very naturally arises as to whether these little figures had
any meaning or performed any function aside from that of simple
decoration. I&nbsp;feel inclined to take the view that in their present
condition they are survivals of ideographic originals; that if their
past could be unveiled we would find that in the primitive ages they
were not exclusively employed for ornament. The animals made use of
originally were the embodiment of mythologic conceptions, and their
images were revered or served as fetiches or charms, and because of this
they came to have a permanent place in art. They were applied to the
vessel because its office had reference to them or because they were
thought to have a beneficial effect upon its functions. It is evident
that their employment was governed by well established rules and that
they occupied places and occurred in numbers and relations not wholly
dependent upon the judgment of the individual potter. We may suppose
that they occur in twos because the handles with which they were
associated occurred in twos; or, if they serve to take the place of the
extremities of the animal forms in the semblance of which the vases were
originally modeled, their positions may be related to the original
positions of the heads and tails of those forms. It is not improbable
that the conventional incised and relieved ornaments, the meanders,
nodes, and varied marks refer also to the creatures or the markings of
the creatures with which the vessel was associated.</p>

into two grand divisions: the <i>unpainted</i> ware and the

first of these, the terra cotta or biscuit ware, comprises a larger
number of pieces than any other group and is readily distinguished by
its colors, which include only the pale grayish yellow and reddish tints
of the burned clay. The second is limited to a small number of pieces
and is black or very dark upon the surface and dark within the mass.</p>

<p>This biscuit-like pottery is not in any way inferior to the painted
varieties. It bears evidence of great freedom in handling, and serves,
perhaps better than any other class of products, to illustrate the
masterly skill and the refined taste of the ancient potter. It is said
to occur in the same cemeteries and in the same graves with the more
important varieties of painted ware. The function of these handsome
vessels cannot be determined. It can hardly have been of a domestic
nature, as they show no evidences of discoloration or wear, and we are
left to speculate upon the possibility of a purely ceremonial use. The
paste is moderately fine, but contains an extremely large share of
gritty sand; the slip is thin and has received but a slight degree of
polish, so that the surface has a dead, somewhat granular effect. As a
rule the vases are of small size and are very thin walled. The forms are
symmetrical and exceptionally graceful. The ornamentation includes
incised figures (mostly geometric), raised decoration (of&nbsp;similar
character), and animal forms in the round. The following illustrations
are intended to epitomize the multitude of forms, as anything like a
complete representation is out of the question.</p>

<p>Bowls, which form a leading feature of the pottery of most primitive
peoples, are here rarely seen, excepting as mounted upon tripods or
annular bases. There are in the collection a number of small cups of
hemispherical shape that may have served as spoons, ladles, or drinking
vessels. A&nbsp;few of these are outlined in Fig.&nbsp;70. Two have
minute projections resembling handles affixed to the rim. In rare cases
these are so prolonged as to be of service in handling the cup; but in
no instance is there an approach to the long cylindrical handles seen in
the earthenware of other districts.</p>

<p>In following the form scale upward from these simple shapes we find
the orifice becoming more constricted and the neck more pronounced. The
margins are upright, incurved, or flaring, and give variety and grace to
the outlines. A&nbsp;tendency toward elaboration
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page069" id = "page069"> </a>
<!-- png 131 -->
of ornament accompanies the development of form. Bands of incised or
relieved figures are carried around the neck, shoulder, and handles and
are added in such a way as greatly to enhance the beauty of the vessel.
The forms of these vessels are so graceful and the finish is so perfect
that one is tempted to present an extended series, but it will be
necessary to confine the illustrations to a limited number of type
specimens. Fig.&nbsp;71 shows a somewhat shallow form of great
simplicity and grace. That in Fig.&nbsp;72 is deeper, with a narrow neck
and a more decidedly conical shape. Two minute grotesque figures are
perched upon the shoulder. Fig.&nbsp;73 represents a larger vessel of
good form, which has a neat incised pattern encircling the slightly
incurved neck. Grotesque heads are set upon the shoulder. A&nbsp;form
somewhat more refined is shown in Fig.&nbsp;74. The neck is furnished
with a relieved ornament, consisting of a meandered and indented fillet,
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page070" id = "page070"> </a>
<!-- png 132 -->
accompanied by two rows of minute indented nodes. The heads are probably
intended to represent the armadillo. They are hollow and contain movable
pellets. The fillet ornaments are always tastefully treated, and in many
cases represent twisted and plaited cords. Some are marked in herring
bone fashion and others have transverse indentations. Small pellets of
clay were much used and to excellent advantage. They were set on lightly
with the fingers and firmly pressed down with minute pointed or edged
tools and hollow straws or reeds (Figs. 75 and&nbsp;76). Some of these
nodes are finished to represent the heads of animals. This is done with
an ease and a simplicity that call forth our admiration
(Fig.&nbsp;77).</p>

otherwise being uniform with the preceding. We notice in these vessels a
decided tendency towards complexity of outline. Three examples, shown in
Fig.&nbsp;79, have a two storied character, the upper part possibly
being the outgrowth of the collar ornament seen in so many cases. The
large specimen in the center is a handsome piece with square offset at
the shoulder and a decidedly conical base. A&nbsp;chaste ornament in
relief encircles the neck and two grotesque figures are seated upon
opposite sides of the shoulder. The vase at the left has two orifices,
set wide apart. The body is oblong and slightly flattened above. There
are a number of vessels of this conformation in the collection, some of
which have the mouths so close together that the margins or lips
coalesce in part. A&nbsp;superb specimen of this class is illustrated in
Fig.&nbsp;80. The shape is thoroughly satisfactory to the eye, having a
refinement of line rarely attained in native American work. Its symmetry
suggests the use of the wheel, but the closest examination fails to
detect a trace of mechanical appliance, save that left by the polishing
stone. The decoration is simple and effective, consisting of minute
nodes with annular indentations about the necks and of two grotesque
figures, placed with consummate taste in the angles formed by the
contact of the two necks.</p>

these, in some of the examples, are worthy of high admiration. The
specimen presented in Fig.&nbsp;81 attracts attention at once on account
of its resemblance to well known classic forms. It is evident, from a

these potters alongside of the highest masters of the art. The sharp
high elbow and the broadening of the handles at their junction with the
lip are notable features. The latter is shown more satisfactorily in
Fig.&nbsp;82, which is a top view of a companion piece. I&nbsp;wish to
call attention here to a peculiar feature of these handles and one
repeated in vessels of other classes. At the elbow of each handle we
find a device in relief marked with herring bone indentations that would
seem to represent a kind of textile attachment, as if, at some previous
time and perhaps in an antecedent form of vessel, the upright and
horizontal parts of the handles had been stitched or tied together at
this point. Yet it is by no means certain that this feature is not the
survival of some feature of an animal form into the semblance of
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page074" id = "page074"> </a>
<!-- png 136 -->
which, as seen in other examples, this feature has a tendency to
graduate.</p>

<p>These vessels are not numerous, but acquire importance from their
large size, the larger being upwards of eight inches in height.
A&nbsp;few pieces of nearly identical shape, but of small size, are
found among the painted wares. Additional shapes are given in Figs. 83,
84, and 85, and serve to illustrate the extent of variation exhibited in
this group of vases. The small shallow piece is exceptionally fine and
the handles are furnished with animal features of a highly conventional
type. An expansion of the handles somewhat similar to this is frequently
seen in vessels of other classes, especially in those of the handled
group.</p>

<p>Single handles of like character occur in a number of cases upon
minute cups, an example of which is given in Fig.&nbsp;86. It would seem
that possibly in such cases the rim had been expanded and prolonged for
the purpose of giving support to the animal figures with which the
shoulders were embellished. The expansion is probably the outgrowth of
the use of animal figures in connection with simple handles.</p>

<p>We have a number of vessels of this group the bodies of which imitate
animal forms, but they are in nearly all cases furnished with
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page075" id = "page075"> </a>

legs. Rarely we meet with compound or eccentric forms. An interesting
specimen of the latter class is seen in Fig.&nbsp;88. Such shapes are
common in Peru and are occasionally met with in Central America. The two
strong handles are decorated with minute images of birds and the bottom
is concave, an exceptional character in Chiriquian work.</p>

without a series of tripod vases. In shape of body these vases differ
but little from the legless forms already given, excepting where the use
of life forms has led to eccentric modifications. Very great interest
attaches to the modeling of the tripod supports, upon which the potters
have expended much time and ingenuity.</p>

<p>The illustrations given herewith are chosen from a great number of
examples and are intended to convey an idea of the range of forms, both
of the vessels and of their supports. Figs. 89 and 90 show plain forms
of legs, all of which are hollow and contain small pellets of clay. The
openings are generally wide vertical slits, and are placed in front, as
seen in Fig.&nbsp;89, or in the side, as in Fig.&nbsp;90; but in
exceptional cases they take other shapes and are scattered over the
surface, as seen in Fig.&nbsp;91. The legs are often remarkable in form,
being swollen to an enormous size above and terminating in small rounded
points

below. The bowls are symmetrically shaped and graceful in outline. In
Fig.&nbsp;92 I present a group illustrating some of the more eccentric
forms of bowls and a variety of their supports. A&nbsp;very superior
piece and one of the largest of this style is shown in Fig.&nbsp;93.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in a number of cases the legs are modeled to
represent animal forms. This feature is brought out more clearly in
succeeding figures. The creatures represented are often grotesque, as
seen in Figs. 94 and 95. The human form is rarely shown in a way to make
it clearly distinguishable from the figures of monkeys and other
animals. The armadillo is a favorite subject. An example of
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page077" id = "page077"> </a>
<!-- png 139 -->
small dimensions is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;96, in which this animal is
given in characteristic style, and a more pretentious piece is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;97. The characteristics of the creature are very simply but
graphically expressed. In the first the hard ribbed and figured case is
represented by applied fillets and nodes, and in the other by incised
lines. The frog is also much used (Fig.&nbsp;98). A&nbsp;rather
remarkable conception is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;99. Upon the front of
each leg is a curious little animal-like figure, to the front of which
are bound two minute infantile creatures. In the piece presented in
Fig.&nbsp;100, the
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page078" id = "page078"> </a>

legs are grotesque heads, inverted, with wide open mouths and glaring

<p>The legs of these figures are spread out horizontally, so that a firm
support is obtained. The periphery of the body of this vessel is
encircled by a number of nodes and noded projections, which represent
the heads, tails, and spines of two crab-like animals. The heads, with
arms attached, appear at the right and left, and the tails occur at the
front and back just over the heads of the supporting figures. The use of
the crab in this way is quite common. Fish, birds, and a variety of
quadrupeds are similarly treated. Some very interesting examples of
double headed animal vases are found. Two of these are outlined in Figs.
102 and 103, the first having a single orifice and the
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page079" id = "page079"> </a>
<!-- png 141 -->
second a pair of orifices. In many cases the bowl of the vessel is
considerably modified, to give a more decided resemblance to the body of
the creature. This is well shown in Figs. 104-106. The first is probably
intended for a bird: the second resembles an armadillo; and the third
portrays a creature with ears and three horns. The oblong vessel shown
in Fig.&nbsp;107 is modeled after a curious fish,
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page080" id = "page080"> </a>
<!-- png 142 -->
to which the Chiriquians seem to have attached considerable importance.
It is represented with a wide mouth displaying teeth, two spines or
horns upon the end of the snout, and fins upon the back and sides.
Fig.&nbsp;108 gives the top view of another fish vase, which is
supported, as are the others, by three legs. The body is flat and is
encircled by well modeled fins. The head is rather flat and has the eyes
and nose on the upper surface. I&nbsp;close this series of illustrations
with an outline of a fine vase (Fig.&nbsp;109) the rim of which is
decorated with a single head of extremely grotesque and repulsive
character.</p>

Black incised group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>This pottery, although closely related to the other varieties in its
leading features, presents differences of a pronounced character. The
number of specimens recovered is rather small. The largest piece has a
capacity of perhaps a quart. Some of the forms are identical with those
of other groups, but a few are peculiar to this ware. The color is
black, brown, or dark gray, and in most cases the entire mass is quite
dark. The decoration is executed in two somewhat distinct styles: in one
the lines were scratched or engraved subsequently to the hardening of
the clay; in the other
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page081" id = "page081"> </a>
<!-- png 143 -->
they were deeply engraved with a sharp point while the clay was still
moist. The lines are usually very deep and are filled with a white
substance which renders the pattern distinctly visible upon the surface.
It seems probable that the lines were engraved deeply with the intention
of producing this effect. Type specimens are shown in Figs. 110 and 111.
They are small globular bottles, with short necks and wide apertures and
with handles placed at opposite sides of the lip, which is prolonged to
meet them. The design covers a large part of the body and is separated
into two parts by the handles and the undecorated panels that descend
from them. The figures appear to be very highly conventionalized animal
forms, probably serpents. The coiled ends of the ribbon-like dotted
bands are evidently meant to suggest the heads of reptiles. The figures
assume a variety of shapes and grade by degrees from the recognizable
life forms into purely geometric patterns. Examples of the latter style
are given in Figs. 112 and

113. The motives employed, although so conventionally treated, are
pretty certainly identical in origin with the preceding.</p>

<p>There are a number of tripods in this group, some of which have the
deeply incised ornaments and others the shallow ones. The shapes vary
greatly, a&nbsp;few examples being decidedly Costa Rican in type. Pieces
with round bodies have conical legs, like much of the Chiriquian ware,
but those with shallow basins and angular, incurved, upright, or flaring
rims have the Costa Rican tripod. Figs. 114 and 115 may serve to
illustrate this variety. The first is a cup, with upright sides and
thick rim, having an incised geometric pattern. The second is much more
striking in appearance. The surface color is brownish gray in hue and
the simple geometric design was scratched through into the lighter color
beneath after the clay hardened. The legs represent the heads of animals
conventionally treated and are hollow, containing movable pellets. This
specimen is from latitude 8°&nbsp;42´ north, longitude 82°&nbsp;52´
west. Others of this class come from different parts of the
province.</p>

<p>To this class belongs also a small dark vase of peculiar shape and
interesting decoration, which is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;116. The neck
is large and the lip widely flaring, and the body is modeled in
imitation
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page083" id = "page083"> </a>

of the head of some animal, possibly a peccary. The side representing
the face is prolonged, giving an unsymmetric profile, as seen in the
second figure. The eyes are set midway between the ears (which are
placed at the sides) and the nostrils, and are inclosed by curious
engraved figures, probably suggested by the markings of the animal
portrayed. An arched ridge, representing the brows, connects the bridge
of the nose with the ears. The most novel feature of this piece is the
band of incised ornament that crosses the back of the head and serves
probably to carry out the idea of the complete creature. As will be seen
by reference to the figure, it is a guilloche-like interlacing of
fillets, bordered and apparently held in place by longitudinal bands,
beyond which the angles of the ornament project. The pattern is a
modified form of one commonly seen upon the margins of the larger stone
metates, and, although rarely met with in the pottery of Chiriqui, was a
favorite motive with the potters of Costa Rica. This vessel comes from
30 miles north-northwest of David.</p>

<p>The unpainted wares here so briefly described are typically
Chiriquian, and are closely associated in the graves with most of the
leading groups of art products of the province. It must be allowed that
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page084" id = "page084"> </a>

they take first rank in the isthmian states, if not in America, for
simplicity and refinement of form, perfection of method, and purity of
style.</p>


<h5><a name = "pottery_painted" id = "pottery_painted">
PAINTED WARE.</a></h5>

<p>The painted vases of Chiriqui embrace at least ten easily
distinguished varieties of ware. The characters upon which the
classification is based are somewhat heterogeneous and include material,
color, shape, finish, ornamentation, method of manufacture, and
evidences of use. No single character and no one group of characters can
be relied upon to distinguish the different groups. We must depend,
therefore, upon an assemblage of characters or upon one character in one
place and another in another place. Observing a number of striking
differences in two groups of ware, we arrive at the conclusion that
these groups must have been the work of distinct communities; yet we
find very marked differences in wares that (through the possession in
common of some particular feature) we know to be the work of the same
hands. We can, therefore, determine little in regard to the peoples
concerned.</p>

<p>I do not consider the presence in a single grave of two or more
varieties sufficient proof of their common origin, for a number of
distinct wares may come into the possession of one community through
trade, conquest, or the spoliation of tombs; but a constant recurrence
together of the same forms affords strong evidence that the objects were
the work of the people with whom they were buried. Unfortunately our
observations in the field are not sufficiently accurate to enable us to
utilize associations or methods of occurrence in the graves as a means
of classification.</p>

<p>The following classification is, under the circumstances, the best
that I can devise, and is of use mainly as a means of facilitating
description. The name chosen generally indicates a leading or striking
characteristic of the group.</p>

<p>The <i>scarified</i> group, separated widely from all other
varieties.</p>

<p>The <i>handled</i> group and</p>

<p>The <i>tripod</i> group, apparently the work of one community and
devoted to the same or similar uses.</p>

<p>The <i>maroon</i> group;</p>

<p>The <i>red line</i> group;</p>

<p>The <i>white line</i> group;</p>

<p>The <i>lost color</i> group;</p>

<p>The <i>alligator</i> group; and</p>

<p>The <i>polychrome</i> group, no two of which are sufficiently alike
to make it certain, without extraneous evidence, that they were
manufactured by the same community, yet all clearly belonging to one
great family.</p>

<p>These groups are presented in the order given.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">85</span>

<!-- png 147 -->
<p>Before proceeding with the descriptions, however, there are some
matters of a general nature that should be referred to. Technical
questions have already received considerable attention, and I shall need
only to refer here to the painted ornamentation, and at sufficient
length to insure a clear understanding of its treatment and the scope of
its subject matter.</p>

<p>Painted vessels are embellished to some extent also by incising and
modeling, and these methods are employed very much as in the unpainted
pottery already described.</p>

<p>Painted decoration is executed with much freedom and in many cases
with considerable skill. It is greatly varied in method of treatment and
embraces a wide range of motives. Geometric patterns occur in great
variety, but are found to be of types peculiar to Isthmian America. The
conventional meanders, frets, and scrolls so extensively employed in
other regions are here almost unknown. Decorative motives derived from
natural forms are abundant and afford an excellent opportunity to study
the processes of conventional modification. These designs are often
applied in a way to indicate that the decorator possessed a keen sense
of the requirements of the vessel, although the treatment perhaps is not
as universally satisfactory as is the treatment of plastic
embellishment.</p>

<p>The potter, in preparing the vessel for the decorator, ordinarily
finished it with a slip or wash of fine clay, which varied in hue from a
gray white to a pale orange. A&nbsp;slip of bright red tint was also
extensively used. The more delicate hues formed an excellent ground upon
which to work. The slip covered surface was generally polished, often to
a high degree, with the usual polishing implements, the marks of which
can be seen upon the less carefully finished surfaces. By observers
unacquainted with aboriginal methods this polish is liable to be taken
for a glaze, and it has been pronounced a vitreous glaze by a few
writers. It is more noticeable upon specimens that have been handled a
great deal, as is the case with whistles, needlecases, and the like.</p>

<p>The colors utilized in decoration, so far as they have been
preserved, are the ground tints, described above, and the delineating
colors, the latter consisting of black, white, red in various hues, and
a dull purple. An additional color (or&nbsp;perhaps a solution without
particular color) extensively employed in the designs has totally
disappeared. The nature of the various colors has not been determined,
but it is probable that some were of mineral and others of vegetal
origin.</p>

<p>Red was often employed as a ground color, as stated above, and
sometimes covered the whole surface, but more frequently occupied zones
or panels. In such use it was applied and polished down with the slip.
Red was also extensively used in the delineation of decorative figures
in several of the groups of ware, and is in all cases a permanent color.
The hues vary decidedly with the groups of products,
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page086" id = "page086"> </a>
<!-- png 148 -->
suggesting differences in people or in environment. White may have been
freely used, but it is preserved in a few cases only, in which it was
used in the production of simple decorative patterns, and appears to
have been a somewhat thick or pasty color. Black was extensively used
and was of two distinct kinds: a&nbsp;thick permanent pigment, employed
in the delineation of designs, and a thin color, not so permanent and
employed exclusively as a ground upon which to execute designs in other
mediums. The latter may possibly be of vegetal derivation. Its use was
confined to a single variety of ware, the lost color group. The former
was employed in all the other groups, with one exception, the red line
group.</p>

<p>The light purple tint is but sparingly used and only in the
polychrome group. It is very effective in combination with the reds and
blacks upon the orange ground of this ware. It is probably of a mineral
nature.</p>

<p>What I have denominated the lost color was a pigment, or “taking out”
solution, extensively and exclusively employed in the decoration of one
of the principal groups of ware. Its former existence is made known by
its action upon the ground colors and upon the paste or slip within the
areas covered by it. Where superimposed upon black, that color has in
all cases been removed, exposing the underlying tints of the slip in
which the designs are now manifested, the interspaces being still black.
In some cases the lost color has not only removed the black ground, but
has affected the slip beneath, removing it also, and to such a degree
that the polished surface is destroyed and shallow intaglio lines occur,
leaving the interspaces in relief. This circumstance enforces the idea
that possibly the “lost color” was really not a color at all, but an
acid which acted upon the ground colors at once, destroying the black
entirely and leaving the effect now seen. This point must remain for the
present undetermined.</p>

<p>The figures in all cases appear to have been delineated with ordinary
brushes and by purely free hand methods. The degree of skill varies
greatly. The execution in the great body of the work is rather inferior
and indicates a lack of skill and care, but in a limited number of
pieces the manipulation is masterly.</p>

<p>The designs are confined to the show spaces, being exterior in narrow
necked vessels and generally interior in shallow forms.</p>

<p>In arrangement upon the surfaces this decoration presents some novel
features. The slight degree of uniformity in arrangement indicates the
absence of any mechanical aid, such as the wheel, which device would
tend to reduce all decoration to a series of horizontal zones. We
observe indeed the occurrence of horizontal arrangements, but not to a
degree greater than would naturally arise as a result of the
conformation of the vessel. Upright, oblique, and arched arrangements
are frequently met with, and all are safely attributable to the
domination of spaces to be covered or to the influence of antecedent
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>

shapes. Examples and details are given as they come up in the various
sections.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_scar" id = "pottery_scar">
The scarified group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>This group is represented by about forty specimens and is worthy of
especial attention. It comes from the graves of two localities, one near
C.&nbsp;E. Taylor’s hacienda, north of David, on the slopes of Mount
Chiriqui, and the other at Alanje, southwest of David. As a variety of
ware it stands so entirely alone that had it arrived unlabeled no one
would have recognized its affinities with Chiriquian art. It is rather
inferior in material, grace of form, and surface finish, and the
decoration appears to belong to a lower grade of culture than that of
the other groups. It is possibly the work of an inferior race in
comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>Nearly all the vessels are tripods, but a few have rounded or flat
bottoms and a few are supplied with annular stands. The walls are thick
and the shapes are uncouth or clumsy. The paste is coarse, poorly baked,
and friable; near the surface it is a warm reddish or yellowish gray;
within the mass it is a dark gray.</p>

<p>The makers of this pottery, like their brother artificers, took
especial pleasure in the modeling of life forms. The work exhibited in
these specimens is, however, exceptionally rude. In some cases grotesque
heads are attached to the rims of bowls; in others the head, tail, and
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page088" id = "page088"> </a>
<!-- png 150 -->
feet of animals appear about the periphery of the vase; and in a number
of cases the legs of the tripods are modeled to represent the forms of
living creatures. Generally the feet are clumsy in shape and three toed,
suggesting the feet of the tapir.</p>

<p>These vessels are embellished by painting, incising, or scarifying
and by modeling in relief. Color was not employed in the production of
designs, but a dark Indian red pigment was daubed over that part of the
surface not occupied by incised ornament. Little or no slip was used and
the rude geometric patterns were executed with pointed tools in a very
haphazard manner.</p>

<p>The bowls are more numerous than in any other group of the Chiriquian
ware, but, as in the other groups, they are supplied with supports,
either tripods, shaped like the feet of quadrupeds, or rude annular
bases. In most cases the rim expands gradually from below, as seen in
Fig.&nbsp;118, or is recurved, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;119. In a few cases
the basin is oblong or boat shaped and the ends are pointed, as
indicated in Fig.&nbsp;120.</p>

of animals. Details of form and ornament are well brought out in the

animal forms with which the legs are embellished. Each leg is
represented as a complete animal, whose back or breast supports the
vessel and whose cylindrical nether extremity rests upon the ground. The
head in the first example resembles an owl and in the second reminds one
of some crustacean form. An additional specimen of considerable interest
is shown in Fig.&nbsp;127. It is a heavy tripod, having four independent
mouths, all opening into one chamber. The shape is unsatisfactory, being
heavy and unsymmetrical. The exterior surface has the usual scarified
figures and the interspaces and the entire inner surface of the vessel
are painted red and rather carefully polished.</p>

The handled group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The series of vessels to which this name is given comprises a large
number of pieces of unusually even characters.
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page091" id = "page091"> </a>
<!-- png 153 -->
They are obtained from a pretty wide district to the north and west of
David and occur in connection with other groups. They are notable for
uniformity in size, shape, and finish and for the unmistakable evidences
of use over fire which at least three-fourths of them show. With the
exception of a few large caldrons, not yet assigned to a particular
group, they are more like ordinary cooking vessels than any other group
of Chiriquian ware. The size, however, is remarkably small, the average
capacity being about a pint. Larger pieces contain a quart or three
pints.</p>

<p>The body is usually much compressed vertically and is flattish above
and more or less conical below, giving a very graceful contour. The
surface is rather rudely polished and the painting is done with notable
carelessness, as if the intended use were not favorable to the
preservation of the ornament. By means of a heavy brush, red figures,
consisting of splotches, stripes, arches, and encircling bands, were
applied to the yellowish gray surface and sometimes, as indicated by a
smeared appearance, were polished down with an implement. It does not
seem that a slip of ordinary white clay was very generally used. In a
few cases a grayish blue tint appears upon some of the wider spaces.</p>

<p>The handles are perhaps the most notable feature of this ware, and
usually occur two to a vessel; rarely there is but one handle and in a
few cases there are four. This group may be separated into at least four
sections by the styles of handles. Vessels of the two more important
sections have two handles each, which are placed vertically in one
variety and horizontally in the other, reference being had to the
position of the points of attachment. These differences of position have
given rise to a marked difference in the shape of the orifice and of the
lip. The handle is a simple loop, which in the one variety is placed as
seen in Fig.&nbsp;128 and in the other as in <a href =
"#fig132">Fig.&nbsp;132</a>. In the latter case one end of the loop is
fixed to the shoulder and the other end
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page092" id = "page092"> </a>
<!-- png 154 -->
to the lip, which is uniformly prolonged at the contact and is also
widened all around; the result is the curious winged outline shown in

some characters of contour that remind us of well known Grecian forms.
Another novel variation from the type is seen in Fig.&nbsp;130, in which
the arch of each loop is divided by an upright piece. A&nbsp;neat
incised ornament occupies the shoulder of this vessel and the remainder
of the body is finished in pale red.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the handles are rarely wholly plain. Each
loop is supplied with one or more rings or ring-like fillets, or with
small nodes, generally near the most prominent part of the curve or
arch. By the study of a large number of specimens I am able to trace
these puzzling features to their origin. They are the representatives of
life forms which were originally modeled in full detail and which are
still so modeled in many cases. The nodes and like features are
atrophied heads, hands, or feet, and in some cases are marked with
indentations that refer to the eyes or to the fingers or toes, and the
round fillets stand for the arms and legs of animals, or, if notched in
peculiar ways, may be referred to other originals, such as the mouths of
fishes or the spines of crabs. Examples could be given showing all
stages of the progress of simplification.</p>

the realistic life form and the conventional nodes and fillets. In this

clay beneath is manifestly intended for the arms, the handle itself
standing for the body. The loop is upright and joins the shoulder to the
rim. The winged character produced by the expansion at the contact of
handle and lip is shown to advantage in the top view (Fig.&nbsp;133.) In

the vase when viewed from above.</p>

Grotesque figures are attached to the outer surface of the loops, one in
each pair being placed in an inverted position. The two figures seen in
the cut are simple, but those on the opposite pair of handles are
compound, being double above the waist. The faces, hands, and feet of
these figures are touched with red, and the lip and body of the vase are
decorated with carelessly drawn stripes of red. In another case four
plain handles are placed equidistantly about the neck of the vessel.</p>

<p>Typical vessels of this class are in many cases mounted upon tripods,
but, for convenience of description, these are classed with the
succeeding group, which consists mainly, if not entirely, of the same
variety of ware.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, the striking characteristics of this group are the
uniformity of size, shape, and handles, the rude finish and ruder
ornamentation, and the very marked evidence of use over fire.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_tripod" id = "pottery_tripod">
The tripod group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>Closely related in most respects to the group of ware just described
is the striking series of vessels here presented. At first glance the
resemblances are not apparent, but a careful study renders it clear that
the vessels proper correspond closely in both groups. The basins are for
the most part made in the same heavy, rudely finished style, the
decoration is almost equally rude, and the size and the evidence of use
over fire are the same. The strong contrast in appearance is due mainly
to the presence of tripod supports in this group. The legs, which
constitute such a striking feature, are merely appendages to the bodies
of vases already perfect, and are evidently an acquired feature
suggested by some change in function or in the habits of the people. In
this way we are able to account for the
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page098" id = "page098"> </a>
<!-- png 160 -->
rather uncouth look observed in so many cases, the legs being too long
and too heavy to please the cultured taste; yet in many cases the parts
are so adjusted as to give an impression of firmness and strength,
united with a goodly share of grace of line.</p>

<p>The legs are very generally modeled to represent animal forms. In a
majority of cases the fish was chosen because, perhaps, its shape was
suitable or because the fish bore some relation to the use to which the
vessel was to be devoted. Lizards and mammals are also seen and the
human form occasionally appears. In some cases the animal figure is
attached to the upper part of the leg or is perched upon the hip, where
that feature is pronounced. The body, or shaft, is hollow and contains
pellets of clay, sometimes one only and again a dozen or more, and in
order that these may be seen and heard variously shaped slits are cut in
the sides or front of the legs. If the animal represented is a fish or
lizard the entire body is modeled: the head is placed at the top, the
under jaw or neck uniting with the body of the vessel; the tail rests
upon the ground, and the fins or legs appear along the sides of the
shaft. It should be observed that, while in Chiriqui the whole body of
the creature is usually employed in forming the support, in Central
America and Mexico the head alone is very generally used, the nose
resting upon the ground. In less elaborate forms the legs are plain or
have the merest hint of animal form in a node, a&nbsp;notched ridge, or
a slightly modified extremity.</p>

<p>Handles are present in a majority of cases and as in the preceding
group take the form of loops or represent the forms of animals. The
loops are generally attached in a vertical position, connecting the
shoulder with the lip of the vessel, and are plain round ropes of clay
or consist of two or three cords twisted or plaited together. A&nbsp;few
eccentric forms occur and are illustrated early in this section.</p>

<p>The animal shapes are often quite elaborate and appear to bear no
relation to the creatures embodied in the legs of the vessel; neither
does the position of the handles bear any uniform relation to the
positions of the legs&mdash;another indication that the latter features
are recent acquisitions, since features developed together are uniformly
well adjusted.</p>

<p>The rim or lip is generally heavy and flaring, and the neck, which is
short and pretty sharply constricted, is decorated with incised patterns
and with various applied ornaments in relief. The body is graceful in
outline and more or less conical below. As a rule the surface is uneven
and but slightly polished and the figures in red are rudely executed,
but in the more pretentious pieces much care has been exercised in
finishing and painting. Most of the vessels have been used over the fire
and still retain the sooty incrustations. This ware comes from a wide
range of territory to the north and west of David.</p>

decoration.</p>

Tripod vases with shallow basins and eccentric handles&mdash;⅓.</td>

</table>

<p>I present, first, three vases of rather eccentric shapes, the basins
of which are shallow and in two cases are flat bottomed. The handles are
of unusual shapes, consisting of modifications of the lip, as seen in
the illustrations (Figs. 140-142). Life elements are present in all
cases in connection with the handles and legs where these are preserved,
but they are very meager and so abbreviated as to be identified with
difficulty. Incised markings at the ends of the handles represent hands
or feet and eyes are affixed to the upper part of the legs. The ware is
identical with that of the preceding group.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 143.</span> Tripod vase of graceful shape
and neat finish&mdash;⅓.</p>

<p>A representative specimen of the fish legged vessels is presented in
Fig.&nbsp;143. It is one of the most graceful forms in the series and is
neatly finished and embellished, but is thoroughly blackened with soot.
The handles are formed of twisted fillets or ropes of clay and a narrow,
incised, rope-like band encircles the lower part of the neck. Set upon
the neck and alternating with the handles are two scrolls neatly formed
of small round ropes of clay. The fishes forming the legs are very
simply treated. The mouth at the apex is formed by laying on an oblong
loop of clay and the eyes are represented by two round pellets set into
the soft clay of the head and indented with a slit that gives to them
the exact effect of screwheads. A&nbsp;pair of fins&mdash;small incised
or channeled cones&mdash;is placed at the sides of the head and another
at the sides of the body. The cavity contains a single ball of clay and
the slit is long and wide.</p>

The wide mouth exhibits a row of teeth and the body is well supplied
with fins. The head in Fig.&nbsp;144 reminds one forcibly of the
catfish. The snout is furnished with two horn-like appendages;
tooth-like features are formed by setting in pellets of clay, and the
gills are indicated by a punctured excrescence at the side of the mouth.
In other cases a high, sharp cone is set upon the middle of the head
(Fig.&nbsp;145). It is channeled down the sides, as if meant for a
fin.</p>

<!-- png 163 -->
<p>The process of modeling these heads was about as follows: The upper
end of the leg&mdash;the head of the fish&mdash;was first rounded off,
giving the general shape; then parallel incisions were made to represent
the teeth, and around these a fillet of clay was laid, forming the lips,
which were then channeled with a sharp tool. Nodes or flattened pellets
of clay, representing the gills, snout, and eyes, were then laid on and
finished with incision-like indentations. The handles consist of
bird-like heads, with protruding eyes and long bills that curve downward
and connect with the shoulder of the vase. The body is rudely spotted
with red.</p>

<p>A large, uncouth specimen is shown in Fig. 146. The legs are
ponderous and are not neatly adjusted to the vessel. A&nbsp;meander
pattern of incised lines encircles the neck and the body is rudely
decorated with broad red stripes.</p>

<p>There is a general consistency in the use of life forms which is
worthy of notice. The fish and other creatures used, although variously
conceived and treated, are never confused. When the fish is employed no
features suggesting other animals appear and when the heads of other
creatures occupy the upper extremity of the leg all the details refer to
these creatures with uniform consistency. In Fig.&nbsp;147 we have an
unusually graceful shape, decorated about the neck with scrolls and
indented fillets. The legs represent some reptilian form resembling a
lizard. The head projects from the hip and is conventionally treated.
A&nbsp;round fillet fixed at its middle point to the muzzle of the
creature is turned back at the sides of the head and coiled to form the
eyes. The forelegs are attached at the sides near the top and the
recurved terminal point is encircled by rings that stand for the coiled
tail.</p>

shape are characteristic of the lizard. The vessel is small, plain, and
neatly finished. In Fig.&nbsp;149 the legs of the vessel, otherwise
quite plain, are surmounted by heads that seem to represent a dog or
some like animal. A&nbsp;series of neat vertically placed scrolls formed
of round fillets encircles the neck, and below these is a band in relief
imitating a twisted cord.</p>

<p>A vase of unusually striking appearance is presented in Fig. 150. It
is one of the largest tripods in the collection and is characterized by
a high widely expanded lip and a long conical body and by legs of
unusual size and conformation. Small animal figures are perched upon the
projecting hips. The surface of the vessel is rudely finished and is
much blackened by smoke about the upper part of the legs and the
body.</p>

<p>A unique use of the animal form is illustrated in Fig. 151, which
shows a large fragment of one of these tripods. The figure of an
alligator, modeled with a great deal of spirit, is attached to the side
of the vessel, resting partly upon the leg and extending upward
obliquely to the lip. A&nbsp;similar figure upon the opposite side of
the same vase is represented as grasping the form of a man or boy in its
formidable looking jaws.</p>

<p>The alligator, rarely employed in this group of ware, is freely used
in other groups and was probably a creature of importance in the
mythology of Chiriqui.</p>

<p>In one case only, so far as I have seen, is the human form employed
in the supports of these vessels, and in that case, as will be seen in
Fig.&nbsp;152, the result is extremely grotesque. The shape of the basin
is good and the thick, rounded lip and most of the surface are carefully
polished. A&nbsp;disconnected meander of incised lines encircles the
rather high neck, and parts of the body and its attached features
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
<!-- png 167 -->
are painted red. As usual this color was applied along with the slip and
in polishing has become much mixed up with it, giving a mottled effect.
The handles take the form of curious human-appearing figures which sit
against the constricted neck, their heads supporting the rim and their
feet resting upon the shoulder of the vessel. In one case the hands are
held tightly against the lower part of the face and in the other they
are bound together against the chin by a serpent-like cord of clay. The
hollow figures forming the legs of the vase are as grotesque as could
well be imagined. There is no head whatever, and the outlandish features
are placed upon the front of the upper part of the body. The arms and
hands take the conventional position characteristic of the statuary of
the isthmian states and the only traces of costume are bands about the
wrists and a girdle encircling the lower part of the body.</p>

<p>I add, in Fig. 153, one more example, a large, full bodied vase,
which, more decidedly perhaps than any of the foregoing, proclaims its
relationship to the preceding group. If the three rather clumsy legs
were knocked off there would remain a large beautifully shaped and
finished vase, with a constricted but flaring rim not in any way
distinguishable from those of the preceding group. The legs in this case
are less perfectly adapted to the vessel than in the other examples, as
if the potter, skillful in modeling the vessel, had only recently
undertaken to add the tripod. The slit in the outer face of the leg is
unusually wide and the inclosed ball is three-fourths of an inch in
diameter. The most remarkable feature of this vessel is the pair of
unique figures affixed to the upper surface of the body near the lip,
and which would seem to be intended to represent semihuman monsters. The
arms and legs are contorted and serpent-like in appearance and terminate
in most cases in heads of serpents instead of
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
<!-- png 168 -->
in hands and feet. The attitude is expressive of agony or horror. It
seems to me probable that, contrary to the rule in primitive art, these
strange figures do not embody any well defined or serious conception,
but are rather exhibitions of the fancy of the potter. They occupy small
unpainted panels, which are finished in neat incised patterns. The
remaining surface is a bright red.</p>

<p>It may be noted, in recapitulation, that these vases, although
elaborately modeled and often well finished, are rudely decorated and
very generally show use over fire; that the legs, though often graceful
and well proportioned, are in many cases clumsily adjusted to the body,
giving a decidedly unsatisfactory result as a whole. This ware was
devoted to domestic uses, or, if otherwise, in all probability to the
burning of incense. Animal forms are freely employed, but in a rather
rude way. The fish form is more generally used than any other, and is in
all cases embodied in the legs of the vessel, the head joining the body
of the vessel and the tail resting upon the ground. These
representations exhibit all grades of elaboration from the fairly well
modeled to the merest suggestion of animal character&mdash;any one
feature, as the mouth, the eye, the fins, or the tail, being alone a
sufficient suggestion of the creature to satisfy the potter and keep
alive the idea of the fish. Other animal forms are employed in modeling
the legs, and exhibit equally varying degrees of elaboration, and it is
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
<!-- png 169 -->
worthy of especial note that creatures are not confused or confounded,
so far as I can discover, at any stage of the simplifying
process&mdash;that a fish is still purely a fish if nothing is left to
represent it but a node or an incision. There is no apparent
relationship between the animal forms forming the legs and those
attached to the body or to the rim of the vessel.</p>

The pottery of the two groups already presented exhibits characters so
uniform throughout that there need be no hesitation in placing them
together as the work of one community and of one period of practice of
the art; but between these groups and those that follow there is a wide
gap. The differences are so marked that, if they had come from widely
separated localities, very intimate relationships would not have been
suggested.</p>

The maroon group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>For the want of a better name I have called the group first to be
presented the maroon group, on account of its color. Our collection
comprises not more than a dozen pieces of this ware. The locality from
which they come is called Los Tenajos by Mr. <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘McNeil’">McNiel</ins>, but he has not distinguished
them in any way from the other varieties, and I am therefore unable to
say whether or not they occur together with others or under identical
conditions. In symmetry of outline, diversity of shape, and cleverness
of modeling this ware takes a high rank, but there is no painted
ornament. The surfaces are usually well polished, and all exposed parts
have received a coat of purplish maroon colored paint. The paste
contains a great deal of fine sand, and is yellowish upon the surface
and generally quite dark within the mass. Considering the small number
of pieces, the scale of form is remarkably varied. There are plain bowls
with incurved rims and with flaring rims, vases with
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
<!-- png 170 -->
round bases, with annular stands, and with tripods, and life forms
wholly unique. Perhaps the most usual form is that shown in
Fig.&nbsp;154, which represents a small cup with incurved rim and a
narrow annular base. The shoulder is embellished with three groups of
small nodes, of four each, which refer to some animal form. In other
similar vases the form of the creature is given in more realistic guise.
A&nbsp;larger vase, similar to this in most respects, has a rounded
contour and incurved lip. The periphery is supplied with four plain
nodes. Another, shown in Fig.&nbsp;155, has a wide recurved rim,
a&nbsp;character seen to equally good advantage in some of the following
figures. In the small vase represented in Fig.&nbsp;156 the treatment of
animal forms in connection with the body of the vessel is shown to good
advantage.

<p>A most interesting tripod is shown in Fig. 157. The bowl is
beautifully modeled, is symmetrical, and has a flaring rim, rounded and
polished on the upper surface and drooping slightly at the outer margin.
The body is hemispherical and is supported by three grotesque
anthropomorphic figures that strongly remind us of the “mud head” masks
used in one of the dances of the Zuñi Indians. The head is a rounded
ball, upon which pellets of clay are stuck to represent the features.
The arms are set against the sides of the body, as in other isthmian
specimens, the hips are excessively large, the legs straight, and the
feet small and united to form the foot of the vessel. Nearly the entire
surface is finished in a dark purplish red paint, which appears to have
been polished down as a slip. A&nbsp;companion piece is considerably
smaller and the supporting figures are very grotesque and somewhat
crouched, as if bearing a very heavy weight.</p>

<p>A number of large basins or caldrons, collected in Chiriqui, and
fragments of vessels of extraordinary size resemble this ware in
material, color, and finish. The rims of the larger pieces are upwards
of an inch thick and the walls are in cases three-fourths of an inch
thick. A&nbsp;number of large vessels of similar ware now in the
National Museum were collected in Costa Rica and Nicaragua.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_red" id = "pottery_red">
The red line group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The group of vessels to which I have given this name is represented
by about a dozen specimens, which indicate a wide range of form and
exhibit a number of unique characters.</p>

<p>The localities from which they are derived extend from 8°&nbsp;20´ to
8°&nbsp;40´ north latitude and from 82°&nbsp;40´ to 82°&nbsp;50´ west
longitude.</p>

<p>The paste is of about the usual composition, but takes a variety of
tints on burning, a&nbsp;light gray orange prevailing. The finish of the
surface is about the same as in other groups. The decoration consists of
life forms and their conventional representatives in relief and of
carelessly executed geometric designs, the pigment used being a bright,
sienna-like red.</p>

<p>As will be seen by reference to the illustrations, the forms are
varied and pleasing, but for the most part repeat outlines common to
other groups. The handles, single or in twos, are upright loops, and the
tripods are in nearly all cases looped or annular, an unusual feature in
other groups.</p>

<p>I present three illustrations, two of which were given in outline in
the introductory pages. The first (Fig.&nbsp;158) has a well
proportioned, somewhat globular body, supported by three legs formed of
looped bands of clay. On the shoulder are two small animal forms,
probably meant for frogs. The spaces between these are occupied by
panel-like arrangements of red lines. The surface is yellowish gray in
color, excepting where blackened in the baking. The paste has

cracked in firing, a&nbsp;feature observed in a number of pieces
belonging to this group.</p>

<p>A unique piece is represented in Fig. 159. The single handle is a
high projecting loop and connects with the margin of the orifice, which
rises to meet it, and with the lower part of the shoulder. An animal
form, apparently anthropomorphic, is embodied in this vessel. The upper
part of the vessel, separated by a slight constriction from the body
proper, represents the head of the creature, the nose, mouth,
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>

and eyes appearing on the front and the ears at the sides. A&nbsp;few
incised lines seen upon the inner surface of the handle stand for the
hair. Upon the shoulder are two sharp nodes, standing for the breasts,
and between these are markings that represent a necklace. A&nbsp;rude
design in red lines covers the upper surface of the body.</p>

<p>A graceful shape is illustrated in Fig. 160. The paste is a grayish
orange on the surface and is rather dark within the thicker portions of
the walls. The under surface is much blackened by use over fire. An
interesting feature is seen upon the handles at the highest point of the
loop. Instead of the single indented transverse fillet observed in
similar forms in other groups, we have two such features, set about an
inch apart, and between them are two indented nodes which stand for
eyes, and a number of indentations within the space refer to other
features of the animal suggested. Upon the shoulder and collar of the
vessel are carelessly drawn geometric patterns in red lines.</p>

<h6><a name = "pottery_white" id = "pottery_white">
The white line group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>One group of vases, of which we have but four pieces, is
characterized by the use of a whitish pigment in decoration. Not one of
the collections that I have seen is well supplied with this class of
ware, and hence little can be said of its varieties of form and
ornament. All are tripods, but the shapes of the vessels vary
considerably. Two small pieces are from latitude 8°&nbsp;40´ north and
longitude 82°&nbsp;32´ west. One of these is shown in Fig.&nbsp;161.
They are small, rather carelessly finished tripods, with narrow necks
and flattened bodies. The inner surface of the orifice and the under
side of the body are painted a dull red. The remainder of the surface is
a warm reddish gray, the color of the slip and the paste. The legs in
the piece figured represent some small creature with a rabbit-like face
and a body which tapers gradually to the base. Two feet are placed near
the middle of the body, which is striped transversely with white lines.
A&nbsp;white collar crosses the neck and the eyes are white dots. The
upper surface of the vase is embellished with two animal figures,
executed in a white earthy pigment. They may refer to the alligator,
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
<!-- png 174 -->
but the drawing is too conventional to admit of full identification. The
companion piece is a little larger, and the upper surface is decorated
with three groups of broad white stripes, bordered by rows of dots,
which extend from the base of the neck to the periphery of the body. The
legs are similar to those of the other piece. The little animal figure
fixed to the upper end or hip is identical with that seen in the
following illustration.</p>

</div>

<p>The large tripod vase presented in Fig. 162 is distinct in many ways
from anything in the collection and is remarkable for symmetry of form
and neatness of finish. The body is a long, symmetrical cone and the
legs are long, straight cylinders, neatly rounded off to a point below.
A&nbsp;thick rim projects at a sharp angle and is rounded up toward the
margin. The legs are hollow, and through two pairs of lateral slits a
number of small pellets can be seen, which rattle when the vase is
moved. Rudely modeled little animals, with erect ears, large feet, and
conical tails, are fixed to the upper end of the legs. The ground color,
the slip, and the paste are of a reddish
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
<!-- png 175 -->
gray cast. The greater part of the surface seems to have been painted
red, but the vase has been used over fire to such an extent that little
of the original color remains. The body and the legs have been decorated
with geometric patterns in a whitish pigment that can be scraped off
like indurated clay. The little animal figures were also painted white.
A&nbsp;vase very similar to this, from which the legs have been removed,
and the surface smoothed down, has a longer and more graceful body and a
similar rim. Another piece, exhibiting similar yet even more strongly
marked characteristics of shape, belongs to the collection of Mr.
J.&nbsp;B. Stearns.</p>

The lost color group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>In number of specimens this group is second to none, excepting
perhaps that given under the head of terra cotta ware. Nine-tenths of
the pieces may be classed as bottles, which have rather short, wide
necks and globular bodies, slightly conical below and in cases flattened
above. They range in size from one inch to nearly a foot in height, but
the average capacity is not above a pint. Aside from the bottles there
is a wide range of shapes. There are shallow bowls and various complex
and compound forms. Animal forms are associated with all classes of
vessels. Tripod supports are limited to rather modest proportions, and
handles, although often present and greatly varied in style, do not
constitute an important feature. These vessels are remarkably well
preserved and exhibit few traces of abrasion by use or of blackening
over fire. The paste is fine grained and usually of a light yellow gray
tint throughout.</p>

<p>The surface was finished either in a light colored slip or in a
strong red pigment. In some cases the light tint was used exclusively
and again the red covered the entire surface, but more frequently the
two were used together, occupying distinct areas of the same vessel and
forming the groundwork for decorative patterns in other colors. They
were usually polished down with very great care, giving a glistening
surface, upon which the markings of the tool can still be seen.</p>

<p>I have already described the methods of decoration, but may review
them briefly here. The bright red color, which forms such a prominent
and pleasing feature, is, as stated above, only a ground tint and is not
used in any case in the delineation of design. The actual patterns, so
varied and interesting, were worked out in a pigment or fluid now
totally lost, but which has left traces of its former existence through
its effect upon the ground colors. In beginning the decoration,
a&nbsp;thin black color, probably of vegetal character, was carried over
the area to be treated, and upon this the figures were traced in the
lost color. When this color (if&nbsp;it was indeed a pigment, and not
merely an acid or “taking out” medium) disappeared, it carried with it
the black tint beneath, exposing the light gray and red tints of the
ground and leaving the interstices in black. The interstitial figures
thus formed are often of such a character as to be taken for the true
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
<!-- png 176 -->
design. In examining the decoration of this ware it is essential that
this fact should be kept in mind, as otherwise great confusion will
result.</p>

<p>The nature of the materials employed cannot be determined. Applied to
the polished surface, they were easily removed. The black ground tint is
now easily rubbed off and in most cases is much injured by handling or
by contact with the soil. The lost color may have been similar to the
white, argillaceous pigment used by the Aztecs, which has in many cases
partially or wholly disappeared, leaving its marks upon the ground
either by deadening the polish or by removing portions of the slip and
the paste upon which it was laid, presenting the ornament in
intaglio.</p>

<p>The designs are infinitely varied in appearance and arrangement, yet
are far from having a mixed or heterogeneous character. It is probably
our lack of knowledge of the origin and history of the elements and
their derivations that causes confusion. Both geometric and imitative
elements abound and are blended in perfectly graded series. The
treatment of geometric figures is peculiar to Chiriqui and in many
respects is peculiar to this group of ware. Classic forms, such as the
meander, the scroll, and the fret, rarely occur and are barely
recognizable. It appears from a close study of all the work that motives
derived from nature have greatly leavened the whole body of decoration.
This matter will receive attention as the examples are presented and
will be treated with greater care in a succeeding section.</p>

<p>Plastic decoration, aside from the life forms so commonly associated
with the body of the vase and with the handles and legs, is not of
importance. The high degree of polish required in this ware tended to
simplify all relieved features.</p>

<p>The presence of life forms in relief has produced important
modifications in the appearance and the arrangement of the painted
devices, and in many cases there is a manifest correlation between the
plastic and the painted forms: as, for example, when the body of the
vase was thought of as the body of the animal, the extremities of which
were placed upon its sides, the colored figures carried out the idea of
the creature by imitating in a more or less conventional way the
markings of the body. This will be understood through reference to the
examples presented in the following pages.</p>

<p>I will present, first, a series of bottles, selecting at the
beginning those decorated in the more purely geometric style and
gradually approaching those upon which animal forms are treated in a
literal manner. The few pieces selected for illustration are totally
inadequate to the proper representation of the group and must be
regarded only as average specimens, more or less typical in
character.</p>

<p>I give first a number of examples in which the decorative devices are
arranged in horizontal zones. In Fig.&nbsp;163 broad bands of ornament,
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>

consisting of scalloped and plain lines, encircle the neck and the body
of the vessel. In finishing this piece the whole surface was painted a
rich red and highly polished; then a black coat was applied, covering
the body from the lip to the base of the design; and finally the
delineating fluid was applied, removing the black, as shown in the
narrow lines, the sharply dentate bands, and the broad, plain band
between. The second example (Fig.&nbsp;164) varies somewhat in shape and
design, but is identical in color and manipulation. The dark figures are
merely the interspaces, although they appear at first glance to have
been intended for the design proper.</p>

<p>In a numerous series of vessels the decorated bands are divided into
compartments or panels, often four in number, which spaces are occupied
by lines and figures of greatly diversified characters. In the example
shown in Fig.&nbsp;165 the ground color of the principal zone is in the
light yellow gray tint of the slip, the remainder being red. This lends
brilliancy to the effect.</p>

<p>In the vase shown in Fig. 166 the treatment is in a general way the
same, but the compartments are triangular and are separated by lines
that form a disconnected meander. An additional example is given in
Fig.&nbsp;167. Here the principal zone is expanded to cover the whole
upper surface of the vase, which was finished in the light colored slip
to receive it. The principal lines are arranged to give the effect of
rays when viewed from above, but as seen in the cut they give the effect
of a carelessly connected meander. The groups of lines are
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
<!-- png 179 -->
bordered by series of dots. A&nbsp;great number of pieces are painted in
this style. The effect is varied by altering the shape of the
interspaces or by modifying the number and relationship of the lines,
dots, and figures.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar also in general effect to the last example is the
work upon another important series of vases. Instead of the simple
meandered or zigzag arrangement of parts, two of the dividing lines of
the zone run tangent to the neck of the vase on opposite sides, forming
arched panels and leaving upright panels between.
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>

In the example presented in Fig.&nbsp;168 the arched areas are filled in
with lattice-like arrangements of lines. In others we have dots,
checkers, and varied geometric combinations, and in very many cases the
figures are derived from life forms. The same may be said of the devices
that occupy the spaces between the arches. The piece shown in
Fig.&nbsp;169 exhibits a somewhat more elaborate treatment, but the
motives and arrangements are much the same. These vessels are peculiar
in the treatment of the ground. The entire surface is red, with the
exception of narrow bands of light ground color, which outline the
arches and encircle the periphery. In other cases these bands are red,
the remainder of the ground being light. Series of lines are drawn from
the lower border of the zone to the center of the base of the body.</p>

<p>In a small group of vases we have a radiate ornament within the
arches and in a few cases the arched lines are continued down around the
base of the vessel, forming vertical circles in which rosette-like
designs are formed by repeating the radiate figures in an inverted

position below the peripheral line. The elaboration in these circular
inclosures is very remarkable, as will be seen by reference to the three
examples given in Figs. 170, 171, and 172. In the first case the
peripheral line is a red band nearly one-half an inch wide and the rays
appear in groups above and below it. Within the four broader black rays
(Fig.&nbsp;170<i>a</i>), which are the interspaces or remnants of the
ground, groups of lines have been drawn, in most cases curved at the
inner ends like an opening frond and accompanied in all cases by series
of dots. An examination of a number of vessels shows various degrees of
convention. It is clear, however, that these devices, showing curves,
hooks, and dots, are not of technical or mechanical origin, but that
they refer to delineative originals of which they are survivals; but we
must remain in the dark as to what the originals were or what was the
precise nature of the idea associated with them in the mind of the
decorator. Another question refers to the arrangement of the parts of
the design in the five preceding figures. The distribution of the
designs is a matter of great interest, and much may be learned from a
close study of these specimens.</p>

<p>Horizontal zones appear in the ceramic decoration of all countries,
and result, no doubt, from technical causes; but the division of zones
into compartments of peculiar shape is due to other influences.
I&nbsp;believe the peculiar arched arrangement here seen results from
the employment of plastic features, such as handles or life forms. The
ancient races were accustomed to conceive of the vessel as the body of
an animal, an idea originating in the association of mythologic
conceptions with art. The head and the tail of the particular creature
thought of were attached to opposite sides of the vase and consequently
interfered with the original zonal arrangement of the design where it
existed, or where it did not exist the sides were filled with devices
representing the markings of the creature’s body. The decoration now
consisted of four parts, two in the round or in relief and two in color,

seen in Fig.&nbsp;173. The same result would spring from the use of two
handles, such a common feature in this ware. The lateral spaces reached
from the periphery to the base of the neck and were most readily and
naturally separated from the plastic features by lines extending across
the shoulder tangent to the neck and forming arches (Fig.&nbsp;174). In
time the plastic features, being difficult to manage, would gradually
decrease in boldness of modeling and finally disappear, leaving a space
upon which the life form could be symbolized in color (Fig.&nbsp;175).
Now it happens that in this collection we have a series of examples
illustrating all stages of this change, the first, the middle, and the
final steps being shown in the above figures.</p>

<p>In multiplying these vessels the original forms and associations of
decorative features are necessarily to some extent lost sight of; the
panels change in shape, number, and relationships; and devices
originally appropriate to particular spaces are employed
indiscriminately, so that the uninitiated see nothing but confusion. All
devices are delineations of or have more or less definite reference to
the creature or spirit associated with the vessel.</p>

<p>I will now pass over the many hundreds of pieces with designs too
conventional to furnish a clew to the original animal forms, yet still
suggesting their existence, to those in which the life forms can be
traced with ease or in which they are delineated with a much nearer
approach to nature. The manner of introducing life forms into the panels
of the encircling zones is illustrated in the following figures. In the
vase shown in Fig.&nbsp;176 there are four panels, two short and two
long, separated by vertical bands. The short panels are black, but the
long ones are occupied by rudely drawn figures of alligators, some of
which are very curiously abbreviated. At the right hand in the cut we
have simply the head with its strong recurved jaws and notched crest.
The principal figure at the left is a two headed alligator, the body
being straight and supplied with two feet. The ground finish of the
decorated band is in the light gray tint and the alligator figures and
vertical septa now appear in that color. The ground of the remainder of
the surface is red. It will be seen that in this case the panel outlines
are rather elaborate and that the neck and base are striped in a way to
enhance considerably the beauty of the vessel. Additional examples of
animal devices are given in Figs. 177 and 178. The significance of the
curious figure
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
<!-- png 184 -->
seen in the first is not easily determined, although we do not hesitate
to assign to it an animal origin. There is a suggestion of two sitting
figures placed back to back between the upright serrate lines. In the
second piece, which is from another vessel, the space between the
serrate lines is occupied by a sketchy figure which, in the phraseology
of heraldry, may be likened to a monkey rampant.</p>

<p>In Figs. 179 and 180 I present very interesting examples in which the
arched panels are used. In the first the compartments are occupied by a
favorite Chiriquian motive, which consists of groups of lines curled up
at one end like unfolding fronds. The whole group represents a very
highly conventionalized animal figure (Fig.&nbsp;179<i>a</i>). The
devices occupying the upright panels take the place of the animal heads
shown in several preceding figures. In the arched panels shown in
Fig.&nbsp;180 we have the frond-like motive treated in a manner

figures are fully and systematically presented in a succeeding

<p>Many of these globular vases are unusually handsome. The polished
ground is red or is varied with stripes or panels of the whitish slip.
Over this ground the whole surface was painted black and then the lost
color was employed to work out the design. The coiled figures were
produced by drawing the lines in the lost color. The interspaces were
then roughly gone over with the same pigment in such a way as to leave
the figures inclosed within rather uneven black borders. The
presentation of these ornaments brings me naturally to the consideration
of a number of very puzzling forms which, if taken alone, must
inevitably be referred to vegetal originals. In Fig.&nbsp;181 we have a
handsomely shaped vessel, finished in a polished red ground and
decorated in the usual manner. In the main zone&mdash;here rather high
up on the vase&mdash;there is a series of upright figures resembling
stalks or stems with scroll-like branches springing from the sides. The
stalks are probably the septa of the panels and the leaves are the usual
reptilian symbols. About the widest part of the body of the vase is a
band of ornament probably representing an animal.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable ornament is shown in Fig. 182. The decorated
zone of the vessel from which this is taken is divided into three
panels, each of which contains stem-like figures terminating in flower
shaped heads and uniting in a most remarkable way animal derivatives and
vegetal forms. I&nbsp;am inclined to the view that here, as in

the preceding case, the resemblance to a vegetal growth is purely

<p>In striking contrast with the globular forms just given are the
angular outlines presented in the following illustrations. The first is
flattened above, the body being much expanded horizontally and having a
sharp peripheral angle. Upon the shoulder, occupying the places of and
probably standing for animal heads, are two cruciform
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
<!-- png 187 -->
nodes, about which the scroll-like decorations of the upper surface are
coiled. We see by this that in the mind of the potter a correlation
existed between the plastic and the painted devices even in these
conventional decorations. The second illustration represents a neatly
finished bottle, with upright sides and conical base, upon the shoulder
of which minute animal figures are perched. The painted design is nearly
obliterated. The third example is unique. The sides are upright and the
bottom is flat. The ornament occupies the entire surface and is divided
into two sections or zones by a red band about the middle.</p>

<p>Complex and compound forms are comparatively rare. A double vessel is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;186, and a second, varying somewhat from the first in
shape and ornamentation, is presented in the succeeding figure. Vessels
of this form are always small, but are neatly constructed and finished
with much care. The strong handles are more or less arched and connect
the inner margins of the two lips. The bodies of the twin cups are
closely joined, but the two compartments are not connected.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to present a satisfactory series of the plastic
features characteristic of this group of products without extending this
paper inordinately. Handles, legs, and life forms are varied and
interesting; they are not so boldly treated, however, as in some of the
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
<!-- png 188 -->
other groups. This is a result perhaps of the unusual degree of polish
given to all parts of the surface preparatory to the application of
designs in color, the processes tending to subdue and simplify the
salient features.</p>

</div>

<p>With reference to life forms it has already been pointed out that the
painted figures generally imitate or typify animal forms, and it is
important to note that these figures are in very many cases used as
auxiliaries to plastic features in the development of particular
conceptions. This is shown to advantage in Fig.&nbsp;188, which
illustrates a small, well formed bottle, having two large human-like
heads attached to opposite sides of the body. There are no other plastic
features, but the heads are supplied with arms and legs, rudely
expressed in black lines, which are really the interspaces of the lines
drawn in the lost color. These painted parts occupy the zone usually
devoted to decoration and, as will be seen by reference to the cut,
resemble closely the radiate or meandered figures seen in vases of the
class shown in <a href = "#fig167">Fig.&nbsp;167</a>. The arms are
joined to the lower part of the head and extend upward to the neck of
the vessel, where they terminate in rudely suggested fingers. Rising to
the right and left of the arms are legs terminating as do the arms.
A&nbsp;double row of dots is carried along each member, and thus we have
a suggestion of the relation of the dots and dotted lines, seen in more
highly conventional forms, to the markings of the creature represented
or symbolized. The grotesque faces are covered with lines which follow
the forms as if imitating markings upon the skin. Another example,
equally suggestive, also employing an animal form, is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;189. It is a cup, mounted upon three feet, which has attached
to one side the head of a peccary, modeled with more than usual skill.
The ears of the animal appear at the sides of the vessel and the tail is
opposite the head. The lines and dots seen upon the head are carried
along the sides of the vessel as far as the ears and
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
<!-- png 189 -->
undoubtedly represent the markings of the animal’s skin. Behind the ears
the markings are different in character and purely geometric.
A&nbsp;view of the under side of the vessel is shown in Fig.&nbsp;190
and illustrates a treatment characteristic of the tripod vases of this
class. In other cases, instead of fixing the head of the animal upon one
side
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
<!-- png 190 -->
and other members of the body upon other sides, two heads, or two
complete creatures, are placed opposite each other.</p>

</div>

<p>I present next (Fig. 191) a piece in which there is no recognizable
relationship between the painted and the plastic features. It is a small
tripod cup with upright walls, upon which two characteristic Chiriquian
human figures, male and female, are fixed. The painted figures upon the
sides of the vessel are geometric, but refer possibly to some character
or attribute of the modeled figures or are the survivals of figures
belonging to vessels of this shape or style before the life forms were
associated with them. The legs, however, so far as can be determined,
are not related to the human motive, as they are modeled and painted to
imitate the heads of alligators.</p>

<p>I shall now present a few shallow bowls or pans mounted upon tripods.
They vary in dimensions from a few inches in diameter to a foot or more
and are strongly made, symmetrically formed, and neatly finished. The
polished surfaces are mainly red. The designs were executed in the usual
way in the lost color, upon a black ground, and are confined chiefly to
the exterior surface. The alligator is the favorite motive, and in a
number of cases is quite graphically, although still conventionally,
rendered. As in the preceding examples, the animal heads represented in
the legs do not always correspond to the creatures embodied in the
painted decoration.</p>

<p>In Fig. 192 we have a representative example of moderate size and
ordinary finish. The decorated band is divided into panels, three of
which are long and contain figures of the alligator. The other three are
short and are filled with conventional devices, related perhaps to that
animal. The legs are apparently intended to resemble the heads of
alligators. A&nbsp;large piece, nearly twelve inches in diameter, is
very similar in shape and decoration, but the legs resemble puma
heads.</p>

<p>The specimen shown in Fig. 193 is extremely well made and differs
decidedly from the preceding. The sides are upright and the lip is
recurved and thick. The legs represent some animal form with thick body,
eyes at the top, and a tail-like appendage below that turns up and
connects with the side of the body. The form of the bowl is symmetrical
and the surface carefully finished and polished. The exterior design is
divided into panels, as in the preceding case; the figures are simple
and geometric. The inside of the upright portion of the wall is
decorated with vertical lines and bands and the bottom is covered with
an octopus-like figure, now partially obliterated.</p>

<p>The remarkable example shown in Fig. 194 illustrates a number of the
points suggested in the preceding pages. It is a large bottle of the
usual contour and color, mounted upon three high legs, which are slit on
the inner surface and contain movable balls of clay. Two handles, placed
at opposite sides of the neck, represent human or anthropomorphic
figures. These figures and the neck and base of the vessel were finished
in the red slip. The broad zone extending from the neck to some distance
below the periphery was finished in the gray slip, with the exception of
the frames of two panels beneath the handles and the foundation lines of
two large figures of alligators, which are in red. The surface, when
thus treated, was well polished and then a coat of black was laid upon
it, and upon this details of the designs were drawn in the lost color.
The figures of the alligators exhibit some striking peculiarities. The
hooked snout, the hanging jaw, the row of dotted notches extending along
the back, and especially the general curve of the body are worthy of
attention.

The alligator group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The group of ware to which I give the above name is perhaps the most
interesting in the collection, although numerically inferior to some of
those already presented. Its decoration is of a very striking character
and may serve to throw much light upon the origin and evolution of
certain linear devices, as it illustrates with more than usual clearness
the processes of modification.</p>

<p>I will first present a representative series of the vessels, in order
that they may in a measure tell their own story; yet it is not possible
without
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
<!-- png 193 -->
the direct aid of a full series of the objects themselves to convey a
clear and comprehensive notion of the metamorphoses through which the
forms and decorations pass.</p>

<p>This group, like that last described, is composed chiefly of bottle
shaped vases with globular bodies and short, wide necks; but there is no
danger of confusion. By placing a series from each group side by side a
number of marked differences may be noted. In the lost color group the
neck is decided in form, the body is usually somewhat flattened above
and is distinctly conical below, and the prevailing color is a rich dark
red. In the alligator group the body is more nearly globular and the
curves of the whole outline are more gentle; the prevailing color is a
light yellowish gray. The reds and the blacks, which are used chiefly in
the figures, are confined to rather limited areas.</p>

<p>Besides the bottle shaped vases, there is a limited series of the
usual forms, and a few pieces exhibit unique features. The management of
life forms is especially instructive. Handles are rare and legs are
usually not of especial interest, as they are plain cones or at most but
rude imitations of the legs of animals. Shallow vessels are invariably
mounted upon tripods and a few of the deeper forms are so equipped.
Usually the sizes are rather small; but we occasionally observe a bottle
having the capacity of a gallon or more. The materials do not differ
greatly from those employed in other groups of ware. The paste is fine
grained and light in color, sometimes reddish near the surface, and
where quite thick is darker within the mass. A&nbsp;slip of light
yellowish hue was in most cases applied to the entire surface.
A&nbsp;red ochery pigment was in some instances used in finishing the
lip and the base of the body, and occasionally the red pigment was
applied as a base, a&nbsp;kind of sketch foundation for the decoration
proper. For example, when the alligator was to appear upon the side of
the vessel, the principal forms were traced in broad lines of the red
color, and these were polished down with the <ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">slips.</ins> When the polishing process was
complete, the details of the figure, were drawn in black and in cases
partially in red. Black was the chief delineating color, the red having
been confined to broad areas, to outlines, and to the enframing of
panels. In execution, therefore, there is a decided contrast with the
preceding group, and it may be added that there is an equally strong
contrast in both treatment and subject matter of the ornament. The
motives are derived almost wholly from life forms and retain for the
most part features that suggest their origin. The subjects are chiefly
reptilian, the alligator appearing in a majority of cases, and hence the
name of the group.</p>

<p>I present first a few examples of plain bottles which have no
extraneous plastic features. The decorations are arranged in two ways,
in zones about the upper part of the body or in circular areas,
generally four in number, equidistantly placed about the shoulder of the
vessel.</p>

<p>An example of the first style is given in Fig. 195, which represents
the largest piece in this group of ware. The form is symmetrical and
very pleasing to the eye. The surface is not very highly polished and
shows the marks of the polishing implement distinctly over the entire
surface. Two black lines encircle the flat upper surface of the rim and
the outer margin is red. The neck and a narrow zone at the upper part of
the body are finished in a cream colored slip and the body below this is
red. The narrow band of ornament occupies the lower margin of the light
colored zone and consists of five encircling lines in black, three of
which are above and two below a band one-half an inch wide, in which
five much simplified figures of alligators are drawn. Besides these
figures there are two vertical septum-like bands. Each of these consists
of three lines bordered by dots, which probably have some relationship
with the alligator. The decorated zone of these vessels is divided in
various ways into panels, some of which are triangular, while others are
rectangular or arched. The latter form is seen in Fig.&nbsp;196. Five
arches, having no border line above, are occupied by abbreviated
alligator devices. The number of compartments
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>

<p>A very peculiar form of decoration consists of circular or
rosette-like ornaments, such as are shown in Fig.&nbsp;197. Four
slightly relieved nodes an inch or more in diameter are placed upon the
shoulder of the vessel. These are encircled by red lines which inclose
two black lines

each, and within these are peculiar devices in black. Other vessels
furnish figures of greatly diversified characters, most of which
evidently refer to life forms. A&nbsp;full series of these is given in a
subsequent section of this paper, where the origin of the nodes and the
manner in which the painted figures probably became associated with them
will be fully set forth.</p>

<p>In the series of outlines presented in Fig. 198, we have some of the
varieties of form and decoration of both the ordinary bottles and the
plainer tripod cups. Each example presents certain features of
particular interest. The handsome little bottle (<i>d</i>) with the
plastic ornament about the neck and the zone of geometric ornament in
black and red lines is unique. The double necked bottle is an unusual
form and its decoration consists of a strangely conceived representation
of the alligator. The tripod vases are worthy of close attention: the
piece illustrated in <i>b</i> has a zone of ornament separated into
three parts by vertical spaces, each part being enframed in black. The
sections are divided by red lines into three panels, each of which
contains a conventional figure of an alligator in black. The piece shown
in <i>a</i> is unique in its decoration. Four angular fret links in
black are inclosed in as many panels, bordered by red and separated by
blank spaces. These fret links, as I shall show further on, probably
refer to or symbolize the alligator. The legs of the cups are all
conical and are marked with short transverse lines in black, which have
a direct reference to the markings of the animal to which the vase was
consecrated. A&nbsp;careful study of the preceding illustrations leads
to
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
<!-- png 197 -->
the conclusion that in the mind of the potters there was a close and
important relationship between the vessel and the reptilian forms
embodied in both plastic and surface embellishment. The series of
examples which follow have a bearing upon this point. I&nbsp;shall begin
with that in which the creature is most literally rendered.</p>

<p>In Fig. 199 the whole conformation of the vessel is considerably
modified through the attempt to perfect the likeness of the alligator,
whose head, tail, and legs are graphically rendered. The body, head, and
tail are covered with nodes, each of which is encircled by a black ring
and has a black dot upon the apex. Dotted rings and short strokes of
black occupy the interspaces. These devices represent the spines and
scales of the creature’s skin. The legs are marked with horizontal
stripes and oval spaces at the top inclose three dots each. The general
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>

color of the vessel is a dark brown. This piece should be compared with

</div>

<p>A somewhat different treatment is shown in Fig. 200. Here the animal
form has undergone considerable modification. There are but three
legs&mdash;a concession to the conventional tripod&mdash;and the body
exhibits, instead of the nodes and the markings of the creature’s skin,
two conventional drawings of the whole animal. Now, by higher and higher
degrees of convention, we come to a long series of modified results
which must be omitted for want of room. We find that the plastic
features are gradually reduced until mere nodes appear where the head
and the tail should be, and finally in the lower forms there remains but
a blank panel or a painted device, as already shown in a preceding
section. The painted devices are also reduced by degrees until all
resemblance to nature is lost and geometric devices alone remain.
I&nbsp;observe in this association of plastic and painted features a
lack of the perfect consistency I had learned to expect in the work of
primitive peoples. It is easy to see how, from painting the markings of
the creature’s skin upon the body of the vessel, the painter should come
gradually to delineate parts of the creature or even the whole creature,
but we should not expect him to paint a creature distinct in kind from
that modeled, thus confusing or entirely separating the conceptions;
this has been done, apparently, in the vase illustrated in
Fig.&nbsp;202, where the plastic form represents a puma and the painting
upon the sides seems intended for an alligator. It will be seen from the
figures given that the devices of the panels or sides do not necessarily
represent the markings of the animal’s body, as in Fig.&nbsp;201, but
that they may refer to the entire creature (Fig.&nbsp;200) or even to
what appears to be a totally distinct creature (Fig.&nbsp;202).</p>

<p>If realistic or semirealistic delineations are confused in this way
it is to be expected that highly conventional derivative figures, so
numerous and varied, should be much less clearly distinguished; that
indeed there should be no certainty whatever in the reference to
originals. It is difficult to say of any particular conventional device
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>

that it originated in the figure of the animal as a whole rather than in
some part or character of that animal or of some other animal.</p>

<p>A very instructive example bearing upon this subject is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;203. Attached to one side of the basin is a pendent head
resembling that of a serpent or a turtle. A&nbsp;kind of hood overhangs
the head and extends in a ridge around the sides of the vessel,
connecting with the tail of the creature, which is also pendent and
hooded. Four legs support the vessel and are marked with transverse
stripes of red and black paint. The upper surface of the head is covered
with reticulated lines in black, and bands of conventional ornament in
the same color extend around the sides of the vessel, uniting the head
with the tail of the animal. A&nbsp;single band of ornament passes
beneath the body, also connecting those members. It is plain that these
painted bands serve to complete the representation of the reptile.

But, as I have just shown, they are as likely to stand for the whole
creature or to be the abbreviated representative of the whole creature
as to represent merely the markings of the body. These devices, as
arranged in the zone, resemble in a remarkable degree the conventional
running scroll.</p>

<p>I have but one more example of the alligator vases to present, but it
is perhaps the most remarkable piece in the collection (Fig.&nbsp;204).
It illustrates to good advantage both the skill and the strange fancy of
these archaic potters. A&nbsp;large vase, having a high flaring rim and
a subcubical body, is supported by two grotesque human appearing
figures, whose backs are set against opposite ends of the vessel. The
legs are placed wide apart, thus affording a firm support. The heads of
the two figures project forward from the shoulder of the vase and are
flattened in such a way as to give long oval outlines to the crowns
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>
<!-- png 201 -->
which are truncated and furnished with long slit-like openings that
connect through the head with the main chamber of the vessel. The
openings are about two and a half inches long and one-eighth of an inch
wide and are surrounded by a shallow channel in the flat, well polished
upper surface. The extraordinary conformation of this part of the vessel
recalls the well known whistling vases of South America; but this piece
is too badly broken to admit of experiment to test its powers. It is
generally likened to a money box. In order to convey a clear conception
of the shape of the upper surface, I&nbsp;present a top view of the
vessel (Fig.&nbsp;205).</p>

<p>A front view of one of the supporting figures is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;206. Although certainly not intended to represent a human
figure with accuracy, it is furnished with a crown, as are the figures
in gold and stone, and is covered with devices that seem to refer to
costume. The features are extremely grotesque, the nose resembling the
beak of a bird and the mouth being a mere ridge, without indications of
the lips. The face and the chest are painted with curious devices in
red. The funnel and body of the vase are decorated with subjects that
seem to have no connection with the plastic features and no relation to
one another in subject matter. The upper panel, surrounded by a
framework of black and red lines, contains the figure of an alligator
much simplified and taking a peculiar position on account of the shape
of the space into which it is crowded. The figure occupying the body
panel is that of a very strangely conventionalized two tailed monkey and
is enframed by a wide red line. On the shoulder of the vessel is an
ornament consisting of a number of angular hooks attached to a straight
line. The effect is like that of fretwork, but the figure is probably
derived from a modified animal form. The paste of this
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
<!-- png 202 -->
vase is sandy and is reddish gray near the surface and quite dark within
the mass. The modeling is thoroughly well done, and the surface, which
is of a somber, yellowish gray tint, is highly polished. The figures are
drawn chiefly in black, red being confined to broad lines and areas. De
Zeltner published photographic illustrations of a similar vase with his
pamphlet on the graves of Chiriqui. That specimen is now,
I&nbsp;believe, in the hands of Prof. O.&nbsp;C. Marsh, of New Haven. It
corresponds very closely in nearly every respect with the example here
described.</p>

The polychrome group.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The National Museum collection contains but three examples of this
most artistic of the wares of Chiriqui. Its claim to superiority rests
upon a certain boldness and refinement of execution, combined with
nobleness of outline and a type of design much in advance of other
isthmian decoration. It is probably most nearly allied to the ware of
the alligator group, and it possesses some of the characteristics of the
best Central American work. Unlike the other wares of Chiriqui, this
pottery has a bright salmon red paste and the slip proper is a delicate
shade of the same color. In nearly all cases undecorated portions of the
surface are finished in
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
<!-- png 203 -->
red, which appears to have been polished down as a slip. The designs are
in three colors&mdash;black, a&nbsp;strong red, and a fine gray
purple&mdash;which, in combination with the bright reddish ground, give
a very rich effect. The first example, shown in Fig.&nbsp;207, is a
large, nearly symmetrical bottle with a short neck and a thick, flaring
lip. The inner surface of the orifice and the lower half of the body are
finished in red and the neck and shoulder in the salmon colored slip.
A&nbsp;wide zone of ornament encircles the upper surface of the body.
The designs are executed with great skill in red and black colors and
include two highly conventional figures, probably of reptilian origin.
The manner of their introduction into the zone is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;208. The oval faces are placed on opposite sides, taking the
positions usually occupied by modeled heads. Each face is supplemented
by a pair of arms which terminate in curiously conventional hands, and
the two caudal appendages are placed midway between the faces, filling
triangular areas. The body of the vase serves as a body for both
creatures. In the illustration, the red of the design, which is carried
over all of one face save the eyes and mouth and serves to emphasize the
features of the other face, is indicated in vertical tint lines and the
black is given in solid color. This vase is twelve inches in height.</p>

<p>A second example, illustrated in Fig. 209, is a fine piece of
somewhat unusual shape. The orifice is trumpet shaped and rather too
wide for good proportion. The body is flattened above and conical below
and is supported by a rather meager annular foot. The paste is of a
light brick red color, and the slip, as seen in the ground of the
decorated belt, is a pale gray orange. Undecorated portions of the
surface are painted red. The ornamented zone is interrupted by two pairs
of handle-like appendages set upon the outer part of the shoulder. These
projections may possibly have served as handles, as they are perforated
both horizontally and vertically, but they are at the same time
undoubtedly conventionalized animal forms, the creature being
represented by the four flattened, transversely marked arms or rays and
an eye-like device painted upon the top of each figure. The painted
devices are seen in plan in Fig.&nbsp;210, where the relations of the
relieved features to the zone of painted decoration are clearly shown.
This zone is divided into panels of unequal dimensions, and within these
a number of extraordinary devices are drawn in three colors, red, black,
and purple. These are distinguished in the plan by peculiar tint lines.
The designs are of such a character as to leave little doubt that they
are ideographic, although at present it is impossible to guess the
nature of the associated ideas. The annular foot observed in this
specimen illustrates the first step in the development of a feature the
final stage of which is shown in Fig.&nbsp;211. The latter
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
<!-- png 205 -->
shape is such as would result from inverting the preceding form,
removing the conical base of the body, and using the funnel shaped
orifice as a stand. This highly developed shape implies a long practice
of the art. The form is a usual one in Mexico and in Central America.
The bowl is shallow and is set gracefully upon the stand, the whole
shape closely resembling simple conditions of the classic kylix. The
color of the paste is a pale brick red and that of the slip approaches
orange. The walls are thick and even and the surface is very carefully
polished.</p>

<p>The painted decoration is of unusual interest. The colors are so
rich, the execution is so superior, and the conception so strange that
we dwell upon it with surprise and wonder. The central portion of the
bowl is occupied by what would seem to represent a fish painted in
strong, firm, marvelously turned lines, and in a style of convention
wholly unique. The outlines are in black and the spaces are filled in
with red and purple or are left in the orange hue of the ground. An idea
of the superior style of execution can be gained from Fig.&nbsp;212. It
will be impossible to characterize the details of the drawing in words.
The strange position and shape of the head, the oddly placed eyes and
mouth, and the totally incomprehensible treatment of the body can be
appreciated, however, by referring to the illustration. A&nbsp;careful
study leads inevitably to the conclusion that this
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>

was no ordinary decoration, no playing with lines, but a serious working

raison d’être.</p>

highly specialized condition of the utensil, has not lost sight of the
conception that the vessel is the body of an animal, as we have seen so
often in simpler forms, and that the symbols of the creature should
appear upon it and encircle it. The zone is divided into two equal
sections by small knobs, painted, as are the handle-like appendages in
the preceding specimen, to represent some animal feature. The lateral
sections are occupied by eye-like figures that stand for the markings of
the body of the creature symbolized. They really occupy the spaces left
by a continuous waved body or life line, which they serve to define.
Devices of this class are most frequently met with in connection with
representations of the alligator. They may, however, symbolize the
serpent, as occasionally seen in the alligator group. Decorative
conceptions so remarkable as these could arise only through one channel:
the channel of mythology. The superstitions of men have imposed upon the
art a series of conceptions fixed in character and limited to especial
positions, relations, and forms of expression. It is useless to
speculate upon the nature of the mythologic conceptions with an idea of
arriving at any understanding of the religion of the people; but we do
learn something of the stage of development, something of the condition
of philosophy.</p>

<p>A second piece (Fig. 214), of which two views are given by the same
author, corresponds closely in many respects with the vase illustrated
in <a href = "#fig211">Fig.&nbsp;211</a> and is described in the
following language:</p>

<p class = "quotation">
My collection includes a cup (or&nbsp;chalice) of baked clay 25
centimeters in diameter, mounted on a hollow stand which gives it a
height of 18 centimeters, and the designs of which are very rich and in
perfect taste. The base is hollow and colored red, white, black, and
purple; it has four narrow openings or slits, and the design represents
plaits spirally arranged. The under side of the cup is divided into four
compartments, each of which incloses a dragon painted in black and red
on a white ground; the borders are sometimes red, sometimes purple. The
body of the dragon might have been painted in China, so neat and
intricate is the drawing.</p>

<p class = "quotation">
The design upon the inside of the cup seems to resemble Egyptian art.
The body of a man is seen, painted in red, the arms and legs separated,
and the shoulders bearing the head of the dragon with teeth and crest.
The color is similar to the rest of the piece&mdash;purple, white, and
black. The intermediate spaces are filled with very intricate
designs.</p>

<p>This extraordinary design is shown in Fig. 215, and it will be seen
that it agrees in many respects with figures presented in the lost color
and alligator groups. It is compound in character, however, the head
referring to the alligator, the body and extremities perhaps to a man or
to a monkey. The suggestion of the oriental dragon in this, as in other
examples, is at once apparent, and the resemblance to certain
conventional forms that come down to us from the earliest

known period of Chinese art is truly remarkable. We cannot, of course,
predicate identity of origin even upon absolute identity of appearances,
but such correspondences are worthy of note, as they may in time
accumulate to such an extent that the belief in a common origin will
force itself upon&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>A small number of vases do not admit of classification under any of
the preceding heads. In most cases, however, they are not of especial
interest and may be passed over. They represent a number of varieties of
ware and are possibly not all Chiriquian, their affinities being rather
with the pottery of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. One remarkable piece, of
which a sketch is given in <a href = "#fig50">Fig.
50,&nbsp;<i>c</i></a>, is of large size and is shaped somewhat like an
hour glass, and on account of its peculiar form and markings may be said
to resemble a corset. The upper end is somewhat the smaller, and the
septum, which forms the bottom of the vessel, is placed about an inch
above the base of the foot. The interior surface is smoothly polished
and painted a dark dull red. The exterior is uncolored and neatly
fluted. The series of vertical ribs of the upper end is separated
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148" id = "page148"> </a>
<!-- png 210 -->
from those of the base by a belt of horizontal flutings, and a wide
smooth space extends from the top to the base, the lower section of
which is occupied by a row of button-like, indented knobs. The use of
this utensil may not have been peculiar, but its shape is wholly unique.
It resembles most nearly the ware of the maroon group. Its height is
twelve inches.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of these unclassified vases is a
somewhat fragmentary piece, of which an outline is given in
Fig.&nbsp;216. The ware closely resembles that of the alligator group in
color of the paste and slip, but the base has been supplied with an
annular stand, a&nbsp;feature not observed in that group, and the colors
of the design, with the exception of the black, are unlike those used in
Chiriquian vases.</p>

<p>It will be seen by reference to Fig. 217 that the painted figures are
partially pictorial, the conventional scenes including the sun, the
moon, and stars. The more conventional parts of the design are very
curious and without doubt are symbolic. The border of fret work is
Mexican in style. The sun, which is only partially exposed above the
horizon, is outlined in red and is surrounded by red rays. The

<h4><a name = "misc" id = "misc">MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS OF CLAY.</a></h4>

<p>As primitive peoples advance in culture and the various branches of
art are differentiated, each of the materials employed is made to fill a
wider and wider sphere of usefulness. Clay, applied at first to vessel
making and used perhaps as an auxiliary in a number of arts in which it
took no definite or individual shapes, gradually extended its dominion
until almost every art was in a measure dependent upon it or in some way
utilized it. The extent of this expansion of availability is in a
general way a measure of the advancement of the races concerned. The
Chiriquians employed clay in the construction of textile machinery, as
shown by the occurrence of spindle whorls, and a number of small
receptacles, probably needlecases, are constructed of that material. It
was employed in the manufacture of stools, statuettes, drums, rattles,
and whistles. With less cultured races, such as the Pueblo and mound
builders of the north, such articles were rarely manufactured, while
with the more cultured nations of Mexico and Peru a wider field was
covered and the work was considerably superior.</p>

SPINDLE WHORLS.</a></h5>

<p>The art of weaving was carried to a high degree of perfection by many
of the American races, but the processes employed were of the simplest
kind. The threads were spun upon wooden spindles weighted
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
<!-- png 212 -->
with whorls of baked clay. These whorls are not plentiful in the graves
of Chiriqui, but such as have been collected are quite similar in style
to those of Mexico and Peru. In Figs. 218, 219, and 220 we have three
examples modeled with considerable attention to detail but comparatively
rude in finish. They are in the natural color of the baked clay and are
but rudely polished. The first is encircled by a line of rough, indented
nodes, the second is embellished with homely little animal figures, and
the third with incised patterns and rude incisions.</p>

NEEDLECASES (?).</a></h5>

<p>I have given this name to a rather large class of small oblong or
oval receptacles that could have served to contain needles or any other
small articles of domestic use or of the toilet. They consist of two
parts, a&nbsp;vessel or body and a lid. The former takes a variety of
cylindrical, subcylindrical, and doubly conical shapes, and the latter
is conical and is in many cases furnished with a knob at the top for
grasping with the fingers. The lid is attached or held in place by means
of strings passed through small holes made for the purpose in
corresponding margins of the two parts. These objects were in pretty
general use in the province, as they are found to belong to a number of
the groups of ware, being finished and decorated as are the ordinary
vessels of these classes. A&nbsp;few type specimens are given in the
following cuts. A&nbsp;fine example belonging to the unpainted ware is
shown in outline in Fig.&nbsp;221. It is five inches in height and three
in diameter and is pleasing in shape. The specimen outlined in Fig.

FIGURINES.</a></h5>

<p>I have already called attention to the fact that there is no such
thing in Chiriquian ceramic art as a well modeled human figure and
apparently no indication of an attempt to render the human physiognomy
with accuracy. It is highly probable that the personages embodied in the
mythology of the people took the forms of animals or were
anthropomorphic and gave rise to the peculiar conceptions embodied in
their arts. The strange objects herewith presented are rendered in a
measure intelligible by the adoption of this hypothesis. These figurines
are confined to the alligator group of ware and are quite numerous. They
are small, carefully finished, and painted with care in red and black
lines and figures. They are semihuman and appear to be arrayed in
costume. The head of each is triangular in shape, having a sharp,
projecting profile, with the mouth set back beneath the chin, reminding
one of the face of a squirrel or some such rodent.
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
<!-- png 214 -->
The figures occupy a sitting posture. The legs are spread out
horizontally, giving a firm support, and terminate in blunt cones, which
are in some cases slightly bent up to represent feet. The hands rest
upon the sides or thighs or clasp a small figure apparently intended for
an infant, which, however, does not seem to have any human features. In
one case this figure is placed upon the back of the figurine and appears
to hold its place by means of four feet armed with claws
(Fig.&nbsp;226); in another it is held in front (Fig.&nbsp;227). The
neck is usually pierced to facilitate suspension, and the under side of
the body&mdash;the sitting surface&mdash;is triply perforated, or
punctured if solid, as if for the purpose of fixing the figure in an
upright position to some movable support. The central perforation is
round and the lateral ones, on the under side of the legs, are oblong.
The largest specimen is six inches in height and the smallest about one
and a half inches. They are rather elaborately painted with black and
red devices which, by their peculiar geometric character, are
undoubtedly intended to indicate the costume. The hair is represented by
black stripes, which descend upon the neck, and the face is striped with
red. They are found associated with other relics in the graves and were
possibly only toys, but more probably were tutelary images or

STOOLS.</a></h5>

<p>I have given this name to a class of stone carvings presented in a
previous section, and, for want of a better name, give it also to a
series of similar objects modeled in clay. These are among the most
elaborate products of Chiriquian art. In all cases they are of the
yellowish unpainted pottery and indicate much freedom and skill in the
handling of clay. They do not show any well defined evidences of use,
and as they are too slight and fragile to be used as ordinary seats we
are left to surmise that they may have served some purpose in the
religious rites of the ancient races. They are uniform in construction
and general conformation and consist of a circular tablet supported by
upright circular walls or by figures which rest upon a strong, ring
shaped base. The tablet or plate is somewhat concave above, is less than
an inch in thickness, and has a diameter of ten and one-fourth inches in
the largest piece, descending to seven and one-half in the smallest. The
margin is rounded and usually embellished with a beaded ornament
consisting of grotesque heads, generally reptilian. The variations
exhibited in details of modeling are well shown by the illustrations. In
the example given in Fig.&nbsp;230 the upright portion is a hollow
cylinder, having four vertical slits, alternating with which are oblique
bands of ornament in incised lines and punctures. The projecting margin
of the tablet is encircled by a row of grotesque, monkey-like heads,
facing downward.</p>

occupy the lower margin of the seat plate in the spaces between the
heads of the supporting figures. This specimen illustrates the favorite
Chiriquian method of construction. The various parts were modeled
separately in a rough way and then set into place

in the order of their importance. When this was done and the insertions
were neatly worked together with the fingers, a&nbsp;number of small
instruments were employed in finishing: a&nbsp;sharp stylus for
indicating parts of the costume, and blunt points and small tubular dies
for adding intaglio details of anatomy, such as the navel, the pupils of
the eyes, and the partings of the fingers and toes.</p>

are not carried out in a very consistent manner, as the arms and legs of
the figures become confused with the reptiles and are as likely to
terminate in a snake’s head as in a hand or foot. The rudely shaped
bodies are covered with indented circlets or with short incised lines.
The material, color, and finish are as usual. The height is four and
one-half inches and the diameter of the tablet ten inches.</p>

<p>There are additional specimens in the National Museum. In one case,
the largest specimen of the series, the tablet is supported by five
upright female human figures and the margin is encircled by a cornice of
forty-six neatly modeled reptilian heads. A&nbsp;small example differs
considerably in general shape from those illustrated, the base being
much smaller than the circular tablet. The supporting figures are two
rudely modeled ocelots and two monkey-like figures, all of which are
placed in an inverted position. Similar objects are obtained from the
neighboring states of Central and South America.</p>

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</a></h5>

<p>Something is already known of the musical instruments of the ancient
Chiriquians through fugitive specimens that have found their way into
collections in all parts of Europe and America. The testimony of the
earthen relics&mdash;for no others are preserved to us&mdash;goes to
show that the art of music was, in its rude way, very assiduously
practiced, and that it probably constituted with these, as with most
primitive communities, a&nbsp;serious and important feature in the
various ceremonial exercises. Clay is naturally limited to the
production of a small percentage of the musical instruments of any
people, the various forms of woody growths being better adapted to their
manufacture. We have examples of both instruments of percussion and wind
instruments, the former class embracing drums and rattles and the latter
whistles and clarionette-like pipes.</p>

<h6><a name = "misc_rattles" id = "misc_rattles">
Rattles.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>Besides the ordinary rattles attached to and forming parts of
vessels, as already described, there are a number of small pieces that
seem to have served exclusively as rattles, while some are rattle and
whistle combined in one piece. In no case, however, would they seem to
the unscientific observer to be more than mere toys, as they are of
small size and the sounds emitted are too weak to be perceptible at any
considerable distance. At the same time it is true that they may have
had ceremonial offices of no little consequence to the primitive
priesthood. The simple rattles are shaped like gourds, the body being
globular and the neck or handle long and straight. Like the wares
already described, they are finished and decorated, the majority
belonging to the lost color group. The length varies from three to six
or seven inches. A&nbsp;number of minute slit-like orifices or
perforations for the emission of the sound occur about the upper part of
the body (Fig.&nbsp;233). A&nbsp;septum is placed in the lower part of
the neck, so that the handle, which is hollow and open at the
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
<!-- png 219 -->
upper end, may serve as a whistle. In some cases the lower part of the
neck is perforated for suspension at the point occupied by the septum,
as imperfectly shown in the section (Fig.&nbsp;234). The most
interesting specimen in the collection is shown in Fig.&nbsp;235; it is
especially notable on account of its construction, which points clearly
to the gourd as a prototype. The body is of the usual globular shape,
slightly elongated above. The neck is represented as a separate piece
lashed on with cords by means of perforations made for the purpose, just
as are the handles of similar instruments constructed of gourds and
reeds in Central American countries. The compartments of the handle and
of the body are separate and the sound produced by the small oval
pellets is emitted through slits of the usual form. The top of the
handle is surmounted by a pair of grotesque human figures, male and
female, placed back to back and united at the backs of the heads as seen
in the cut. This object is gray in color and presents the roughened
granular surface resulting from long exposure to the elements.</p>

Drums.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The drum was a favorite instrument with the native American musician.
Early explorers found its use next to universal, and the “tambour” is
even now a characteristic feature of the musical paraphernalia of the
Spanish-Americans. The primitive instrument was made by stretching a
thin sheet of animal tissue over the orifice of a large gourd vessel or
a vessel of wood or clay. The
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>

use of clay was probably exceptional, as there are but three specimens
in our Chiriquian collection. The shape is somewhat like that of an hour
glass, the upper part, however, being considerably larger than the base
or stand. In all cases the principal rim is finished with especial
reference to the attachment of the vibrating head. The example presented
in Fig.&nbsp;236 has a deeply scarified belt an inch wide encircling the
rim, and below it is a narrow ridge, intended perhaps to facilitate the
lashing or cementing on of the head. Two raised bands, intended to
imitate twisted cords, encircle the most constricted part of the body,
a&nbsp;single band similarly marked encircling the base. The surface is
gray in color and but rudely polished. The walls are about three-eighths
of an inch thick, the height sixteen and one-half inches, and the
greatest diameter seven and one-half inches.</p>

<p>The decorated specimen illustrated in Fig. 237 is imperfect,
a&nbsp;few inches of the base having been lost. The shape is rather more

zones, two upon the upper portion and two upon the base. The designs

probable origin are extremely interesting. In another place further on

simple in construction and are limited in musical power, receiving and
perhaps generally deserving no better name than whistles or toys.
A&nbsp;few pieces are more pretentious and yield a number of notes, and
if operated by skilled performers or properly concerted are capable of
producing pleasing melodies. It is not difficult to determine the powers
of individual instruments, but we cannot say to what extent these powers
were understood by the original owners, nor can we say whether or not
they were intended to be played in unison in such a way as to give a
certain desired succession of intervals. There are, however, in a large
number of these instruments a uniformity in construction and a certain
close correspondence in the number and degree of the sounds that
indicate the existence of well established standards. It does not appear
absolutely certain to me that the system of intervals was made to
conform to that of any known scale; but a difficulty arises in
attempting to determine this point, as most of the pieces are more or
less mutilated. We find also that the note producible by any given stop
is not fixed in pitch, but varies, with the force of the breath, two or
even three full intervals. As a result of this a glide is possible to
the skilled performer from note to note and any desired pitch can be
taken.</p>

<p>In material, finish, and decoration these objects do not differ from
the ordinary pottery. A&nbsp;majority belong to the alligator group. The
size is generally small, the largest specimen being about eight inches
in length. The shapes are wonderfully varied and indicate a lively
imagination on the part of the potter. Animal forms prevail very
decidedly, that of the bird being a great favorite. In many cases the
animals copied can be identified, but in others they
cannot&mdash;perhaps from our lack of knowledge of the fauna of the
province, perhaps from carelessness on the part of the artist or from
the tendency to model grotesque and complicated shapes. The following
creatures can be recognized: men, pumas, ocelots, armadillos, eagles,
owls, ducks, parrots,
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
<!-- png 223 -->
several varieties of small birds, alligators, crabs, and scorpions.
Vegetal forms, excepting where in use as instruments or utensils, as
reeds and gourds, were not copied. In the National Museum collection
there are two tubular pipes, probably modeled after reeds, and another
resembles a gourd in shape. The construction of the whistling apparatus
is identical in all cases and corresponds to that of our flageolets (see
sections, Figs. 240 and 242). Plain tubes were doubtless also used as
whistles, and all utensils of small size, such as needlecases and toy
vases, can be made to give forth a note more or less shrill, according
to the size of the chamber. The simplest form of whistle produces two
shrill notes identical in pitch. The shape is double, suggesting a
primitive condition of the tibiæ pares of the Romans. The parts are pear
or gourd shaped, are joined above and below, and have an opening between
the necks. The two mouthpieces are so close together that both are
necessarily blown at once. The note produced is pitched very high and is
extremely penetrating, not to say ear splitting, making an excellent
call for the jungles and forests of the tropics. A&nbsp;small specimen
is presented full size in Fig.&nbsp;239, and the section in
Fig.&nbsp;240 shows the relative positions of the mouthpieces, air
passages, vent holes, and chambers.</p>

<p>Reed shaped instruments are furnished with passages and orifices
corresponding to the other forms. The chamber is tubular and the lower
end is open, and the finger holes, when present, are on the upper side
of the cylinder. One example without finger holes has two notes nearly
an octave apart, which are produced, the higher with the tube open and
the lower with it closed. Perhaps the most satisfactory instrument in
the whole collection, so far as range is concerned, is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;241, and a section is given in Fig.&nbsp;242. It is capable of
yielding the notes indicated in the accompanying scale: First,
a&nbsp;normal series of eight sounds, produced as shown in the diagram,
and,

two octaves above its radical and the others three octaves above. These
notes are difficult to produce and hold and were probably not utilized

tone and high in pitch. It is notable that the pitch of each stop, when
open alone, is identical, the holes being of exactly the same size. In
playing it does not matter in what order the fingers are moved. The
lower note is made with all the holes closed and the ascending scale is
produced by opening successively one, two, three, and four holes. The

small.</div>

<p>Of a distinct type of form, although involving no new principle of
construction, are two top-like or turnip shaped instruments, one of
which is shown in Fig.&nbsp;245. The form is symmetrical, the
ornamentation tasteful, and the surface highly polished. The ware is of
the alligator group and is decorated in red and black figures.
A&nbsp;section is given in Fig.&nbsp;246, <i>a</i>, and top and bottom
views in <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. By reference to these a clear conception
of the object can be formed. The companion piece is identical in size,
shape, and conformation, and, strange to say, in musical notes also. The
tones are not fixed,
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
<!-- png 226 -->
as each can be made to vary two or three degrees by changing the force
of the breath. The tones produced by a breath of average force are
indicated as nearly as may be in the accompanying scale. They will be
found to occur nearer the lower than the upper limit of their ranges. It
should be observed that the capacity for variation possessed by each of
these notes enables the skilled performer to glide from one to the other
without interruption. This instrument is, therefore, within its limited
range, as capable of adjusting itself to any succession of intervals as
is the trombone or the violin. I&nbsp;do not imagine, however, that the
aboriginal performer made any systematic use of this power or that the
instrument was purposely so constructed. It will be seen by reference to
the scale that stopping the orifice in the end opposite the mouthpiece
changes the notes half a tone, or perhaps, if accurately measured,
a&nbsp;little less than that.</p>

<p>Our collection contains several dozen three note whistles or pipes.
Most of these represent animal forms, which are treated in a more or
less realistic way, but with a decided tendency toward the grotesque.
Nearly all are of small size, the largest, an alligator form, having a
length of about eight inches. In the animal figures the air chamber is
within the body, but does not conform closely to the exterior shape. The
mouthpieces and the orifices are variously placed, to suit the fancy of
the modeler, but the construction and the powers are pretty uniform
throughout. There are two finger holes, placed in some cases at equal
and in others at unequal distances from the mouthpiece, but they are
always of equal size and produce identical notes. The capacity is
therefore three notes. The lower is produced when all the orifices are
open, the higher when all are closed, and the middle when one
hole&mdash;no matter which&mdash;is closed.</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
Besides the animal forms there are a number of shapes copied from other
musical instruments or from objects of art, such as vases. A&nbsp;very

A&nbsp;small figure of a bird extends transversely across the body of

bird whistles; its three notes are indicated in the accompanying

<p>The largest specimen in the collection, shown in Fig. 250, represents
an alligator and is finished in the usual conventional style of the
alligator group. The air chamber is large and the sounds emitted are
full and melodious and are lower in pitch than those of any other
instrument in the collection. The cavity in the mouth and head is
separated from the body chamber, and, with the addition of earthern
pellets, probably served as a rattle. The mouthpiece is in the tail and
the finger holes are in the sides of the body.</p>

<p>Mammals are very often reproduced in these instruments. What appears

A&nbsp;representative specimen is shown in Fig.&nbsp;251. The mouthpiece
is in the tail and one of the sound holes is in the left shoulder and
the other beneath the body. The head is turned to one side and the face
is decidedly cat-like in expression. The decoration is in black and red
and may be taken as a typical example of the conventional treatment of
the markings of the bodies of such animals. The tips of the ears, feet,
and tail are red. Rows of red strokes, alternating with black, extend in
a broad stripe from the point of the nose to the base of the neck. Red
panels, inclosing rows of red dots and enframed by black lines, cross
the back. On the sides we have oblong spaces filled in with the
conventional devices so common in other animal representations. The legs
are striped and dotted after the usual manner.</p>

<p>The prevalence of bird forms is due no doubt to the resemblance of
the notes of primitive whistles to the notes of birds. The shape of the
bird is also exceptionally convenient, as the body accommodates the air
chamber, the tail serves as a mouthpiece, and the head is convenient for
the attachment of a cord of suspension. A&nbsp;great variety of forms
were modeled and range from the minute proportions of the smallest
humming bird to those of a robin. The larger pieces represent birds of
prey, such as hawks, eagles, and vultures, and the smaller are intended
for parrots and song birds. The treatment is always highly conventional,
yet in many cases the characteristic features of the species are
forcibly presented. The painted devices have reference in most cases to
the markings of the plumage, yet they partake of the geometric character
of the designs used in ordinary vase painting. The ground is the usual
yellowish gray of the slip, and nearly all the pieces belong to the lost
color and alligator groups.</p>

LIFE FORMS IN VASE PAINTING.</a></h4>

<p>This section is to be devoted to a short study of the decorative
system of the ancient Chiriquians, and more especially to a
consideration of the treatment of life forms in vase painting. Many of
the finest examples of these designs, so far as execution and effect in
embellishment are concerned, have already been given; but it is
desirable now to select and arrange a series to illustrate origins and
processes of growth or modification.</p>

<p>Elements of ornament flow into the ceramic art from a number of
sources, but chiefly in two great currents: the one from art, and
consisting chiefly of technical or mechanically produced phenomena, and
hence geometric, and the other from nature, and carrying elements
primarily delineative, and hence non-geometric. When once within the
realm of decoration the various motives or elements are subject to
modification by two classes of influences or conditioning forces: the
technical restraints of the art and the esthetic forces of the human
mind. Mechanical and geometric elements, although born within the art or
its associated arts, are modified in the processes of adaptation to the
changing requirements and conditions of the art and through the tendency
towards elaboration under the guidance of the esthetic forces; left by
themselves they remain, throughout all changes of use and modification
of form, purely geometric. Imitative elements tend, under the same
influences, to move in the direction of the unreal or geometric. In this
way the realistic forms undergo marked changes, gradually assuming a
geometric character and finally losing all semblance of nature.</p>

<p>Now it must be noted that the decorations of any group of art
products may embody both classes of elements or they may be restricted
rather closely to either. This fact enables us to account for many of
the strongly marked distinctions observed in the decorative systems of
different communities, races, and times. In a recent study of ancient
Pueblo art I traced the decoration to a mechanical origin, mainly in the
art of basketry, and thus accounted for its highly geometric character.
Chiriquian art presents a strong contrast to this, as the great body of
elements are manifestly derived from nature by delineative imitation. It
was further observed in Pueblo art that as
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
<!-- png 234 -->
time went on life forms were little by little introduced into its
decoration and that in recent times they shared the honors equally with
the primitive geometric forms. In Chiriquian art we find but meager
traces of a primitive geometric system, and conclude that either the
earliest art of the people did not give rise to such a system or that
the graphic motives, entering gradually and steadily multiplying,
supplanted the archaic forms, finally usurping nearly the entire field.
As noticed in the preceding sections, there is always a certain amount
of geometricity in the arrangement and the enframing of the designs, as
well as a certain degree of convention in the treatment of even the most
graphic motives; but these characters may be due to the restraining
conditions of the art, rather than to the survival of original or
ancestral features or characters.</p>

<p>In beginning the study of Chiriquian decorative art I found it
impossible to approach the subject advantageously from the geometric
side, as was done in the Pueblo study, since life elements so thoroughly
permeate every part of it. I&nbsp;have, therefore, turned about, and in
the following study present first the more realistic delineations of
nature, arranging long series of derivative shapes which descend through
increasing degrees of convention to purely geometric forms. These
remarks relate wholly to the plan or linear arrangement of the
motives.</p>

<p>As to method of realization, ceramic ornament may be arranged in two
classes: the plastic or relieved and the non-plastic or flat. Life forms
are freely rendered by both plastic and non-plastic methods, and in
either style may range from the highly realistic to the purely
geometric. As shown in a preceding section, plastic life forms in
Chiriquian art appear to have been subject to two divergent lines of
thought, the one trivial and the other serious. Through the one we have
grotesque and perhaps even humorous representations of men and of
animals. The figures are attached to the vessels for the
purpose&mdash;perhaps for the exclusive purpose&mdash;of embellishment,
and often with excellent success, as judged by our own standards of
taste. The other deals with plastic representations apparently of a
serious nature, although utilized also for embellishment. The animal
forms employed are treated in a way to suggest that in the mind of the
artist the creature bore a definite relation to the vessel or its use,
a&nbsp;relationship originating in superstition and preserved throughout
all changes of form. Their office was symbolic, and this office was
probably not always lost sight of by the potter, even though, through
the forces of convention, the animal shapes were reduced to mere knobs,
ridges, or even to painted devices.</p>

<p>In color delineations, although the same subjects are to a great
extent employed, there is necessarily greater constraint&mdash;there is
less freedom as well as less vigor in the presentation of natural forms.
There is apparently no attempt at the grotesque or amusing. The
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
<!-- png 235 -->
variants are practically infinite. The work is more purely decorative
and is perhaps less subject to the restraints of associated ideas and of
use with particular vessels or in definite relations to other features
of the vessel. At the same time it is manifest that these painted
figures are not all merely meaningless decorations, but that many,
throughout all degrees of modification, refer with greater or less
clearness to natural originals, to ideas associated with these
originals, or to the relationship of these originals to the vessel and
its uses.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that a considerable body of nature-derived
elements, plastic and painted, are employed as simple embellishments,
having no other function. This suggests the separation of all
decorations into two grand divisions, based upon the kind of thoughts
associated with them. These divisions may be designated as significant
and non-significant, the term significant referring not to the mere
identification of a device with an original form or to its office as an
ornament, but to its symbolism, to its mystic relation with the vessel
and its uses. But I have to do here with the forms taken by motives,
with their morphology rather than with their signification, as the
latter must, with reference to archæologic material, remain greatly
speculative.</p>

<p>In the application of life forms in vase painting several classes of
modifying and constraining agencies of a technical nature are present,
and the following examples are grouped with the idea of defining these
classes of forces and keeping them in a measure distinct.</p>

<p>Of all the animal forms utilized by the Chiriquians the alligator is
the best suited to the purpose of this study, as it is presented most
frequently and in the most varied forms. In Figs. 257 and 258 I
reproduce drawings from the outer surface of a tripod bowl of the lost
color group. Simple and formal as these figures are, the characteristic
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174" id = "page174"> </a>
<!-- png 236 -->
features of the creature&mdash;the sinuous body, the strong jaws, the
upturned snout, the feet, and the scales&mdash;are forcibly expressed.
It is not to be assumed that these examples represent the best
delineative skill of the Chiriquian artist. The native painter must have
executed very much superior work upon the more usual delineating
surfaces, such as bark and skins. The examples here shown have already
experienced decided changes through the constraints of the ceramic art,
but are the most graphic delineations preserved to us. They are free
hand products, executed by mere decorators, perhaps by women, who were
servile copyists of the forms employed by those skilled in sacred
art.</p>

<p>A third illustration from the same group of ware, given in
Fig.&nbsp;259, shows, in some respects, a&nbsp;higher degree of
convention. The scales are here represented by triangular dentals, which
occupy the entire length of the back. These dentals are filled with the
round dots that stand singly in the preceding cases.</p>

<!-- png 237 -->
<p>In another class of ware&mdash;the alligator group&mdash;the
treatment is quite different, being decidedly more clumsy and realized
by distinct processes; but prominence is given to a number of
corresponding features. The strong curve of the back, the dentals and
dots, and the muzzle and mouth refer apparently to the same creature.
The curiously marked panel in the body of the last example is a unique
feature, which appears, however, in a few other cases.</p>

<p>These drawings occur upon the sides of vases, alternating with the

features in the expression of some mythical idea.</p>

<p>The modeled creature is often represented with two heads instead of
with a head and a tail, and the painted forms, in many cases, exhibit
the same peculiarity as shown in Fig.&nbsp;262. I&nbsp;surmise that the
employment of two heads arises from the need of securing perfect balance
of parts rather than as an original product of the imagination.</p>

<p>It will be interesting, as additional examples are presented, to note
the effect of modification upon particular features of the animal, to
observe how some come into prominence, representing the creature and the
idea, while others fall into disuse and disappear. In nature the line of
the body is perhaps the most strongly characteristic feature, and it is
in art the most persistent. It survives in the stems of many
conventional devices from which all other suggestions of the animal have
vanished.</p>

<p>The following examples depart still further from nature, approaching
the border line between the distinctly imitative and the purely
conventional or geometric phases. In the first (Fig.&nbsp;263) all the
leading features are recognizable, but are very much simplified. The
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
<!-- png 238 -->
jaws are without teeth, the head is without eyes, and the body without
indication of scales. The other example (Fig.&nbsp;264) is of a somewhat
different type and may possibly refer to some other reptilian form, but
many links connecting the two are found. The shape is more angular and
is a step further removed from nature. From shapes as conventional as
this we drop readily into purely geometric forms, as will be seen
further on. These and the preceding drawings are all executed on broad
surfaces, where fancy could have free play. The modifying or
conventionalizing forces are, therefore, quite vague. Variation from
natural forms is due partly to a lack of skill on the part of the
painter, partly to the peculiar demands of ceramic embellishment, and
partly to the traditional style of treatment acquired in still more
primitive stages of culture and in other and unidentified branches of
art.</p>

<p>I shall now call attention to some important individualized or well
defined agencies of convention. First, and most potent, may be mentioned
the enforced limits of the spaces to be decorated, which spaces take
shape independently of the subject to be inserted. When the figures must
occupy a narrow zone they are elongated, when they must occupy a square
they are restricted longitudinally, and when they must occupy a circle
they are of necessity coiled up. Fig.&nbsp;265
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
<!-- png 239 -->
illustrates the effect produced by crowding the oblong figure into a
short rectangular space. The head is turned back over the body and the
tail is thrown down along the side of the space. In Fig.&nbsp;266 the
figure occupies a circle, and is in consequence closely coiled up,
giving the effect of a serpent rather than an alligator. In
Fig.&nbsp;267 the space is semicircular, and we observe peculiar
conventional conditions, some of which may be due to other causes. For
example, such spaces may originally have been filled with purely
geometric figures, which tended to impart their own characters to the
life forms that supplanted them.</p>

<p>Now, it often happens that, as in the last example given, the animal
form, literally rendered, does not fill the panels satisfactorily. The
head and the tail do not correspond and there is a lack of balance. In
such cases two heads have been preferred. The body is given a uniform
double curve and the heads are turned down, as shown in Figs. 268 and
269, or one may turn up and the other down, as seen in Fig.&nbsp;270.
The two headed form may also arise from imitation of plastic forms, as I
have already shown. The example given
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
<!-- png 240 -->
in Fig.&nbsp;268 is extremely interesting on account of its complexity
and the novel treatment of the various features. The two feet are placed
close together near the middle of the curved body, and on either side of
these are the under jaws turned back and armed with dental projections
for teeth. The characteristic scale symbols occur at intervals along the
back; and very curiously at one place, where there is scant room, simple
dots are employed, showing the identity of these two characters. Some
curious auxiliary devices, the origin of which is obscure, are used to
fill in marginal spaces. The shape given in Fig.&nbsp;269 is so highly
modified that it is not recognizable as an animal form, excepting
through a series of links connecting it with more realistic
delineations. It is perfectly symmetrical and consists of a compound
curve for the body, with hooks at the extremities and two appended hooks
for legs. The spots symbolizing the scales are here placed within the
body, showing another step toward complete annihilation of the natural
forms and relations. Three additional examples, showing still higher
degrees of convention, are presented in Figs. 271, 272, and 273. The
series could be filled up and continued indefinitely, connecting the
whole family of devices in which <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelling unchanged: expected form is ‘dentils’">dentals</ins>, hooks,
spots, and circles occur with the alligator radical or with other
reptilian forms confused with the alligator through the carelessness or
ignorance of the decorator. <!--I do not want to be a decorator --></p>

<p>In looking over a large series of the vases it will be seen that the
tendency of decoration is toward the zonal arrangement, the spaces

<!-- png 241 -->
being narrow and long, even when divided into the usual number of
panels. As a consequence the motives tend to take linear forms. Parts
are repeated or greatly drawn out to fill the spaces. This phase of
conventional evolution may be illustrated by a multitude of
examples.</p>

<p>Beginning with an ordinary form in Fig. 274, <i>a</i>, we advance
under the restraint of parallel border lines through the series, ending
in a simple meander, <i>f</i>, the spaces about which are, however,
filled out with the conventional scale symbols, the triangles inclosing
dots. Thus we witness the transformation of the life form into a linear
device, in which the flexures of the body are emphasized and multiplied
without reference to nature, and there is little doubt that the series
continues further, ending with simple curved lines and even with
straight lines unaccompanied by auxiliary devices.</p>

<p>Next to the body line the most important of the alligator derivatives
is the notched or dotted hook, which in the lost color group stands
sometimes for the whole creature, but more frequently for one or more of
the members of its body, the snout, the tail, or the feet. It is
employed singly or in various arrangements suited to the shape of the
spaces to be filled or occurs in connection with the body line or stem,
where, by systematic repetition, it serves to fill the triangular
interspaces. Take, for example, an ornament (Fig.&nbsp;275) which
encircles the shoulder of a handsome vase of the
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
<!-- png 242 -->
lost color group. The space is neatly filled with groupings in which the
simple life coil elements are joined one to another in such a way as to
give somewhat the effect of an ordinary running ornament. The same
motive takes a different form in Fig.&nbsp;276, which is part of the
decorated zone of an earthen drum (see <a href =
"#fig235">Fig.&nbsp;235</a>). Here the body of the creature is
represented by a wide meandered line, and to this the notched or
scalloped hooks are attached with perfect regularity, one to each angle
of the meandered body. In other examples the angular geometric character
extends to every part of the detail and the curved hooks lose their last
suggestion of nature and are entirely dropped or used separately.</p>

<p>The rings, strokes, spots, and dentate figures that serve to
represent the markings and scales of the reptile are among the most
important of the derivative devices and occur in varied relations to
other classes of derivatives. They also occur independently, either
singly or in groupings. Thus we see that the alligator, in Chiriquian
vase painting, is represented by an endless list of devices, and it is
interesting to note that among these are several figures familiar to the
civilized world in both symbolism and ornament.</p>

<p>I present five series of figures designed to illustrate the stages
through which life forms pass in descending from the realistic to highly
specialized conventional shapes. In the first series (Fig.&nbsp;277), we
begin with a meager but graphic sketch of the alligator; the second
figure is hardly less characteristic, but is much simplified; in the
third we have still three leading features of the creature: the body
line, the spots, and the stroke at the back of the head; and in the
fourth nothing remains but a compound, yoke-like curve, standing for the
body of the creature, and a single dot.</p>

<p>The figures of the second series (Fig. 278) are nearly all painted
upon low round nodes placed about the body of the alligator vases and
hence are inclosed in circles (see <a href =
"#fig197">Fig.&nbsp;197</a>). The animal figure
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
<a name = "page181" id = "page181"> </a>
<!-- png 243 -->
in the first example is coiled up like a serpent, but still preserves
some of the well known characters of the alligator. In the second
example we have a double hook near the center of the space which takes
the place of the body, but the dotted triangles are placed separately
against the encircling line. In <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘he’">the</ins> next figure the body symbol is omitted and the
three triangles remain to represent the animal. In the fourth there are
four triangles, and the body device, being restored in red, takes the
form of a cross. In the fifth two of the inclosing triangles are omitted
and the idea is preserved by the simple dots. In the sixth the dots are
placed within the bars of the cross, the triangles becoming mere
interspaces; and in the seventh the dots form a line between the two
encircling lines. This series could be filled up by other examples, thus
showing by what infinitesimal steps the transformations take place. The
round nodes upon which these medallion-like figures are drawn are
survivals of the heads or other parts of animals originally modeled in
the round, but in the processes of manufacture partially or wholly
atrophied. It was sought to preserve the idea of the creature by the use
of painted details, but these, as we have seen, were also in time
reduced to formal marks, symbols doubtless in many cases of the
conception to which the original plastic form referred.</p>

<p>The derivation of the fret and scroll&mdash;most admired of the
decorative motives of numerous races&mdash;has been a fruitful source of
discussion. The vase painting of Chiriqui serves to throw new light upon
the subject. We learn by the series of steps illustrated in the annexed
cuts that the alligator radical, under peculiar restraints and
influences, assumes conventional forms that merge imperceptibly into
these classic devices. In the third series given (Fig.&nbsp;279) the
first figure is far removed from the realistic stage of representation,
but it is one of the ordinary conventional guises of the alligator.
Other still more conventional forms are seen in the three succeeding
figures, the last of which is a typical rectangular fret link known and
used by most nations of moderate culture. The derivatives in nearly all
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<a name = "page182" id = "page182"> </a>
<!-- png 244 -->
the preceding figures can be traced back to the body of the creature as
a root, but there are many examples which seem to have come from the
delineation of a part of the creature, as the head, foot, eye, or
scales&mdash;abbreviated representatives of the whole creature. Such
parts, assuming the role of radicals, pass also through a series of
modifications, ending in purely geometric devices in the manner
indicated in the following or fourth series of examples (Fig.&nbsp;280).
In the first cut we have what appears to be the leg and foot of the
favorite reptile, and following this are other forms that seem to refer
to the same feature. Additional examples are shown in Figs. 281 and 282,
which, while they doubtless arose more or less directly from the life
form, are not so readily traceable through less conventional
antecedents. The first forms part of the incised ornament of a small
vase or needlecase and the second is a section of the zonal ornament of
the tripod cup illustrated in <a href = "#fig203">Fig.&nbsp;203</a>, by
reference to which it will be seen that the zone of devices serves to
connect the head and the tail of the reptile, which are modeled as a
part of the vase; the devices
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
<!-- png 245 -->
therefore represent the markings of the creature’s body, although they
may originally have been derived from the figure of the whole or a part
of the animal rather than from the markings of the skin. In other
examples still more highly conventional figures are found to hold the
same relation to the plastic representation of the extremities of the
creature. They include the meander, the scroll, the fret, and the
guilloche. We find that in the stone metates of many parts of Central
America, nearly all of which are carved to imitate the puma, the head
and tail of the creature are connected by bands of similar devices that
encircle the margin of the mealing plate (see <a href =
"#fig9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>). The alligator form is therefore not
necessarily the originator of all such devices. It is probable that any
animal form extensively used by such lovers of decoration as the ancient
inhabitants of Central America would be found thus interwoven with
decoration. These considerations will serve to widen our views upon the
origin and development of especial devices. As it now stands we are
absolutely certain that no race, no art, no motive or element in nature
or in art can claim the exclusive origination of any one of the well
known or standard conventional devices, and that any race, art, or
individual motive is capable of giving rise to any and to all such
devices. Nothing can be more absurd than to suppose that the
signification or symbolism attaching to a given form is uniform the
world over, as the ideas associated with each must vary with the
channels through which they were developed.</p>

<p>Other classes of geometric figures, derived chiefly from scale or
skin markings, are given in the fifth series. In more realistic phases
of representation the dentate and dotted devices are ranged along the
body of the creature, as in nature, but as convention progresses they
are used independently to fill up spaces, to form the septa of panels,
&amp;c. Many illustrations appear in the preceding pages and additional
examples are given in Fig.&nbsp;283. It is possible that these devices
come from delineations of a number of distinct animal forms; but in the
higher stages of convention confusion cannot be avoided, and must have
existed to some extent in the mind of the decorator; they serve,
however, to illustrate the stages of simplification through which all
forms extensively used for a long period must pass. The laws of
derivation, modification, and application in art are the same in
all.</p>

<p>It has now been shown that life forms and their varied derivatives
constitute the great body of Chiriquian decorative motives; that when
first introduced the delineations are more or less realistic, according
to the skill of the artist or the demands of the art; but that in time,
by a long series of abbreviations and alterations, they descend to
simple geometric forms in which all visible connection with the
originals is lost. The agencies through which this result is
accomplished are chiefly the mechanical restraints of the art acting
independently of voluntary modification and without direct exercise of
esthetic desire.</p>

<p>There may be forces at work of which we find no clear indications.
Some of the conventional forms into which life forms are found to grade
may be survivals of forms originating in other regions and belonging to
other cultures which have through accidents of contact imposed
themselves upon Chiriquian art; such are the scroll, the fret, and the
guilloche; but the thorough manner in which such forms are interwoven
with purely Chiriquian conceptions makes it impossible to substantiate
such a theory. The conclusion most easily and most naturally reached is
that all are probably indigenous to Chiriqui, and hence the striking
deduction that <i>the processes of modification inherent in the art are
of such a nature that any animal form extensively used in decoration may
give rise to any or all of the highly conventional forms of
ornament</i>.</p>

<p>During the progress of this study a question has frequently been
raised as to the extent to which the memory of the creature original or
of its symbolism in first use was kept alive in the mind of the
decorator. It is a well established fact that primitive peoples
habitually invest inanimate objects with the attributes of living
creatures. Thus the vessel, from the time it assumes individual shape
and is fitted to perform a function, is thought of as a living being,
and by the addition of plastic or painted details it becomes a
particular creature, an alligator, a&nbsp;fish, or a puma, each of which
is in most cases the symbol of some mythologic concept. When, through
the changes of convention in infinite repetition, all resemblance to
individual creatures was lost and mere knobs or simple geometric figures
occupied the surface of the vessel, there is little doubt that many of
these features still recalled to the mind of the potter the ultimate
originals and the conceptions of which they were the representatives,
and that others represented ideas, the outgrowth of or a development
from primary ideas, while still others had acquired entirely new ideas
from without. It cannot be denied, however, that there does come a time
in the history of vase painting at which such associated ideas become
vague and are lost and elements formerly significant are added and
combinations of them are made for embellishment alone, without reference
to meaning or appropriateness; but I am inclined to place this period a
very long way from the initiatory stages of the art. It
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
<!-- png 247 -->
may not be possible to find evidence of the arrival of this period, as
it is not necessarily marked by any loss of unity or
consistency&mdash;striking characteristics of ancient American art; for
such is the conservatism of indigenous methods that, unless there be
forcible intrusion of exotic art, original forms and groupings may be
perpetuated indefinitely and remain much the same in appearance after
the associated ideas are modified or lost.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 285.</span> Series of twelve conventional
devices from the decorated zone of a vase.</p>

<p>In our study of the forms and meanings of these devices it should not
be forgotten that collateral branches of art are also simultaneously
employing the same motives and reducing them through other similar
classes of conventionalizing forces to corresponding forms. Recording
arts&mdash;pictography, hieroglyphic and phonetic writing&mdash;carry
life forms through all degrees of abbreviation and change, and all
ceremonial and all domestic arts with which such forms are associated do
the same; and it is not impossible that many conventional forms found
upon pottery are borrowed outright from the other arts. It will be
impossible to detect these borrowed elements unless very literally
transferred from some art the style of which is well known. It would be
comparatively easy to identify literal borrowings from phonetic art or
even from hieroglyphic art, as the form and arrangement of the devices
are quite unlike those observed in pure decoration. We do not know that
Chiriquian culture had achieved a hieroglyphic or a phonetic system of
writing, but it is worth while to call attention to the form and the
manner of employment of some of the devices found upon the pottery. In
Fig.&nbsp;284 I present an outline drawing of a vase, the shoulder of
which is encircled by a broad zone of decoration. This zone is divided
into panels by oblique lines. A&nbsp;row of rectangular compartments
extends along the middle of the band and rows of triangular spaces occur
at the sides. Each space is
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
<!-- png 248 -->
occupied by a device having one or more features suggesting a pictorial
original and doubtless derived from one. In the main row there are
twelve figures, no two of which are identical. Although we are unable to
show that any of these characters had other than a purely decorative
use, we see how richly the ancient peoples were supplied, through the
conventionalizing agencies of the art, with devices that could have been
employed as ideograms and letters where such were needed, and devices,
too, that, from their derivation and use in the art, must in most cases
have had ideas associated with them.</p>


<h3><a name = "resume" id = "resume">RÉSUMÉ.</a></h3>

<p>A brief summary of the more salient points of interest dwelt upon in
this paper may very appropriately be given in this place. We find that a
limited area&mdash;a small and obscure province of the isthmian
region&mdash;possesses a wonderful wealth of art products the character
of which indicates a long period of occupation by peoples of
considerable culture. The art remains are perhaps as a whole inferior to
those of the districts to the north and south, but they possess many
features in common with the art of neighboring provinces. There is,
however, at the same time, a&nbsp;well marked individuality. In
conception and execution these works are purely aboriginal, and, so far
as can be determined by the data at hand, are pre-Columbian, and
possibly to a great extent remotely pre-Columbian. The discovery of
articles of bronze, which metal we cannot prove to be of indigenous
production, is the only internal evidence pointing toward the
continuance of the ancient epoch of culture into post-Columbian times.
The relics are obtained from tombs from which nearly all traces of human
remains have disappeared.</p>

<p>Art in stone covers the ground usually occupied by works in this
material in other Central American countries, save in the matter of
architecture, of which art there are but meager traces. There are rock
inscriptions, statuettes and statues of rather rude character, shapely
mealing stones, elaborately carved seats or stools, many celts of
extremely neat workmanship, spear and arrow points of unique shape, and
a very few beads and pendent ornaments. There are apparently no traces
of implements of war.</p>

<p>In metal there are numerous and somewhat remarkable works. They are
of gold, gold-copper alloy, copper, and bronze. The objects are of small
size, rarely reaching a pound in weight, and they are almost exclusively
pendent ornaments. They were, for the most part, cast in molds, and in
nine cases out of ten represent animal forms. A&nbsp;few bells are
found, all of which are of bronze. Pieces formed of alloyed metal are
usually washed or plated with pure gold.</p>

<p>The great body of relics are in clay, and the workmanship displayed
is often admirable. Vases are found in great numbers, and
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
<a name = "page187" id = "page187"> </a>
<!-- png 249 -->
as a rule are small and shapely, and are so carefully and elaborately
decorated as to lead to the inference that their office was in a great
measure ceremonial. They take a high place among American fictile
products for grace of form and beauty of decoration. There is neither
glaze nor evidence of the use of a wheel. Besides vases we have several
other classes of objects, which include grotesque, toy-like statuettes,
small, covered receptacles resembling needlecases, seat-like objects
elaborately modeled, spindle whorls, and musical instruments. The
occurrence of numerous specimens of the two latter classes indicates
that the arts of weaving and music were assiduously practiced.</p>

<p>An examination of the esthetic features of the ceramic art has proved
exceptionally instructive. We find much that is worthy of attention in
the forms of vases as well as in the plastic or relieved features of
embellishment, and a still richer field is opened by the study of the
incised and painted&mdash;the flat&mdash;decorations.</p>

<p>I have shown that the elements of decoration flow into the ceramic
art chiefly through two channels, the one from art and the other from
nature. Elements from art are mainly of mechanical origin, and are,
therefore, non-imitative and geometric. Elements from nature imitate
natural forms, and hence are primarily non-geometric. Elements from art,
being mechanical, are meaningless or non-ideographic; those from nature
are in early stages of art usually associated with mythologic
conceptions, and hence are ideographic. All decorations may therefore
have four dual classifications, as follows: First, with reference to
method of realization, as plastic and flat; second, with reference to
derivation, as mechanical and imitative; third, with reference to plan
of manifestation, as geometric and non-geometric; and, fourth, with
reference to the association of ideas, as significant and
non-significant.</p>

<p>I have found that the ceramic art, having acquired the various
elements of ornament, carries them by methods of its own through many
strange mutations of form. The effect upon life forms is of paramount
importance, as is indicated by the following broad and striking
generalization: The agencies of modification inherent in the art in its
practice are such that any particular animal form extensively employed
in decoration is capable of changing into or giving rise to any or to
all of the highly conventional decorative devices upon which our leading
ornaments, such as the meander, the scroll, the fret, the chevron, and
the guilloche, are based. It is further seen, however, that ideographic
elements are not necessarily restricted to decorative or symbolic
functions, for the processes of simplification reduce them to forms well
suited to employment in hieroglyphic and even in phonetic systems of
expression. Such systems are probably made up to a great extent of
characters the conformation of which is due to the unthinking&mdash;the
mechanical&mdash;agencies of the various arts.</p>
